**Important: Referees should save a copy of the original submission of a paper they
review. It will be necessary to include this in your portfolio assignment.**

### A note about the proper tone: ###

The peer review process is important for improving the quality of written
mathematical work, but receiving a referee’s report is uncomfortable. The
process is inherently critical and likely negative.

To reduce the strain on authors, it is critical that a referee depersonalize
the comments made. In particular, comments should focus on the paper, and not
on the author. The best mode is to focus each comment on some specific aspect
of the paper, and to never mention the fact that the paper has an author.

> For example: "... paragraph three is confusing. How does one conclude that..."
> is fine. But "... Mr Jones is stupidly confusing the statement of theorem 4
> in paragraph three..." is very bad.

In short, be specific, and talk about features of the paper. If you must
reference the author in some way, refer to him or her as "the author," never
by name.


### What goes in a report: ###

Appropriate things to put in a referee report include:

- comments about the logic of an argument
- comments about passages that you feel are confusing
- comments about poor grammar and spelling
- comments about the appropriateness of figures
- comments about the lack of adherence to the style guide of the journal

A challenging thing is that you should limit yourself to pointing out
deficiencies, and refrain from making corrections for the author. A suggestion
might be allowable. But telling the author how to write a paper is not usually
well received.


### How to file a report: ###

Make a simple text document, and type out each comment on its own line. It helps
if you start each comment with a bit of location information. For example,

> In the third paragraph, the second sentence: the grammar here is unclear.

or

> On page 2, third line from the bottom: Is that really `triangle DEF’? I
> expected ‘triangle EDF’.
