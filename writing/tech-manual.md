title: Transactions in Euclidean Geometry -- Technical manual

Papers written for Transactions in Euclidean Geometry should be submitted as
[Overleaf.com](http://www.overleaf.com) links. Use the template provided on
the TEG homepage, as this will include all of the relevant styling and structure.

## How to Start a Document:

Navigate a web browser to the “Writing” page of our course web site.
Follow the link “THE OVERLEAF.COM TEMPLATE FOR WRITING PAPERS.”

When the document comes up, note the url of the web page you are at. This url
has a random string at the end which serves as Overleaf.com’s identifier for
the file. If you wish to find your file again, you will need this url.

Alternatively, you can make an account at Overleaf.com. This will allow you
to keep all of your papers together in a particular place.

## How to Use the Overleaf.com template:

Scan down the left-hand pane of the Overleaf setup until you see things that
need actual customization. Change the title of the document, and put your name
in the author command. Change the rest of the document as appropriate to use
your theorems and your arguments supporting them.

## How to Include a Figure:

To include a figure, you will first have to make one. I suggest using GeoGebra.
It has a nice “export” feature that will allow you to save a `.jpg` or a `.png`
file. Download that file to the desktop of your working machine.

Then upload the figure into Overleaf.com by using the menu item
`file-> upload figures, etc.` Change the code for a figure in the template to
use the appropriate file name.

## How to Submit your Article to the Journal.

To submit a paper, send an email to the managing editor with the subject line
in the form Euclidean Geometry Task ## where you replace the ##'s with the
proper identifier for the task. From Overleaf there is an option to download a
pdf copy of your paper. Please rename it in the form `LastName-Task-##.pdf` and
attach it to your message. It might be helpful to include the url of the
Overleaf page for your document, too. Send yourself a copy of this email.
This is the way to make sure you can find the file again when you want to edit
it. Documents on Overleaf.com are found by using the proper url, which
contains a fairly random string as an identifier. If you don’t save that string,
it will be near impossible to find your work again.
