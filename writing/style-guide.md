To help potential authors produce the best work they can, TEG has some style
requirements for articles. Please adhere to these when writing.

- Articles should adhere to standard English usage, grammar, and spelling.

- Mathematics is written in present tense. It is eternal and enduring.

- Mathematics is not a personal narrative. Do not choose the personal pronoun
"I" when writing. If a personal pronoun must be used, please use "We."

- Mathematics is written in an active voice, not a passive voice. If you are
unclear on this concept, consider if your sentence might still make sense if you
add “by zombies” at the end of it. If so, it is likely a passive voice
construction.

> For example: The brains were eaten by zombies.  All men are created equal by
> zombies. I got kicked in the face by zombies.

- Each statement written should have a clear justification given from the
literature.

> References to Euclid’s Elements are given this way: "... by Euclid II.13..."
> That is a reference to Proposition 13 of Book II of the Elements.  References to
> work produced for this journal should be given by the name of the author and the
> official sequence number/letter. For example: "... by Mr Jones' Theorem 2.3..."
> and "... by Miss Marple’s Theorem F..." are correct.

- Authors are encouraged to include figures which enhance the exposition. A
simple visual aid can go a long way toward making an argument understandable.
But authors are cautioned that a figure is not an argument, just a supplement.
Write as if there is no figure, but include one anyway.

_Transactions in Euclidean Geometry_ strives for a classical feel, so authors
are discouraged from using
mathematical symbols when words will do. English prose is easier to read than
long strings of strange glyphs.

> For example: The sentence "Triangle ABC is congruent to triangle XYZ." is
> preferable to the sentence "\\(\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ \\)."

- Authors are **strongly** discouraged from using mathematical symbols to start
sentences. This makes a paper jarring to read, and can lead to confusion.
