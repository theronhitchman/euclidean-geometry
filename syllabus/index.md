*Euclidean Geometry*<br />
*Math 3600, Fall 2016*


## Course Description:

This course is devoted to classical, planar geometry, including basic properties
of triangles, circles, quadrilaterals and other polygons, compass and
straightedge constructions, and the notion of area.

Students who complete this course will learn to work _as a mathematician does_.
To meet this challenge, we will run class as an Inquiry Based Learning (IBL)
environment.

Successful students will be proficient in working with axiomatic arguments, and
will improve their abilities to construct, read, write, present,
and critique mathematical proofs. Students will gain insight into the nature and
role of definitions and the process of mathematical work. Students will also
learn something about how to ask and answer their own well-formed mathematical
questions.

## MORE DETAILS

### Inquiry-Based Learning

I conduct each of my classes in some sort of Inquiry Based Learning format.
Essentially, this means that I strive for an active, student-centered
environment. Lectures will be infrequent (if they happen at all), and instead
students will engage in activities that have them participate as working
mathematicians by conducting research at an appropriate level. It is important
to note two fundamental differences between how Inquiry Based classes operate
and traditional lecture classes do:

1. Students will be responsible for producing mathematical understanding. They
  must grapple with the material and construct their own arguments for why
  things are as they appear to be.
2. Students will be the arbiters of correctness in the classroom. The
  instructor’s role is to guide discussion and set the parameters for student
  inquiry. But the students are the ones who say whether a particular argument
  is correct or not—students must take ownership of the mathematics being
  developed.

If you have not experienced an inquiry based learning environment before,
this can be a bit unsettling. Have no fear! It is my job as the instructor
to put you in a position to have success, and to help guide you back toward
success when you miss the mark. Pretty soon, you will be much more comfortable.

#### Why are we doing this?

It is my goal to help you increase your power and ability as a mathematician.
Since I want you to help you improve at doing mathematics, I have structured
our class as an environment where you must do mathematics. This gives you
opportunity to practice and grow, and it gives me an opportunity to see what
you are capable of doing and where I can help you the most.

### Technology: GeoGebra

[GeoGebra][ggb] is a free\*, open-source, interactive and dynamic mathematics
package which has good support for playing with Euclidean geometry concepts.

You can use the software in many ways:

- download your own copy from the web site
- use a Google Chrome Web App
- use the Java-based “web start” version
- one of the Android or iOS apps

Often, I use the chrome web app, which will connect with a UNI Google Drive to save
your work. I encourage you to play around with the software. It is very useful.

[ggb]: http://www.geogebra.org/cms/en/


\* <small>There is a bit of funny business here. GeoGebra is not totally free
to everyone for everything. But it will be free for you as long as you do not
try to use it to build another product to sell.</small>

 ***

 There are two games worth your attention, too.

 [Dragonbox Elements][dragonbox] is not free, but it is not too expensive.
 It is marketed as a way to learn the process of making axiomatic arguments
 in the context of classical geometry. I played it and had fun, and I can see
 the potential.

 [dragonbox]: http://wewanttoknow.com/elements/

 [Euclid the Game][euclid] is a free online game based on GeoGebra. It has
 a large number of construction challenges which are typical objects of study
 in classical geometry built in. You can learn something by completing these,
 too.

### About Assessment

The structure and aims of Math 3600:01 are so radically different from a
traditional “computation based” mathematics course that I find the general
structure of assigning grades from an accumulation of points on homework,
quizzes, and exams to be completely unworkable. If I could get away with it,
I would not assign grades at all, and focus all of my energy on helping you develop.
However, the registrar demands that I assign grades.

I can usually sort out a reasonable “grade” for each student by the end of the
semester by some sort of mysterious process of watching and listening in class.
There are several difficulties with this, which are probably apparent to you:

1. It requires that you trust me and my professionalism.
2. It mixes up formative assessment and summative assessment pretty badly.
3. It has no formal feedback mechanism.
4. Students do not necessarily identify the same things as important that I do.

I can not see any way around problem (1). Even the traditional "points
accumulation" process requires this. I choose not to deal with item (2). In
fact, I am deliberately leaving it mixed up so that I can help you all as much
as possible. But items (3) and (4) are about clear communication of expectations
and of perceived progress. That I can do something about. I choose to use a
communication scheme inspired by things called "Standards Based
Assessment," and "Specifications Grading."

So, I will set out some description of those things I deem as
important for the students in this class to improve upon. This makes clear the
kinds of things I really hope you are working on this term. These are somewhat
nebulous, as we are working on the kinds of qualities and habits you need to be
a competent mathematical professional. We will refer to the items in this list
as the standards.

Also, I will describe a scheme for documentation and communication of your
demonstrated proficiency on the standards, and a little bit about how I will try
to use this information to assign a grade at the end of the term.


Of course, this scheme is as likely to have failures as another, but I hope that
it won’t distort incentives and cloud communication in the way that traditional
grades do. It is my belief that if you tried to “game the system” to improve
your grade, you would be doing exactly the kinds of things I wanted you to do,
and improving your abilities as a mathematician. That is, after all, my only goal.

At any point in the semester, if you would like more detailed discussion of my
view of your mathematical skills and how you can work to improve them (i.e. your
grade), please come talk with me.

### The Standards

Every one of these points is the conclusion to a sentence which begins:
    Students will demonstrate that they can...

#### Mathematical Investigative Process:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- explore examples
- make appropriate choice & use of technology in investigation
- look for and use structure in an uncertain environment
- persevere by trying multiple approaches

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- extend ideas to find or create new mathematics
- devise a relevant new conjecture
- modify hypotheses or conclusions to make work more tractable

#### The Axiomatic Method:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- use definitions to justify assertions (in both directions)
- use literature (Euclid or class work) appropriately to justify assertions
- prove or disprove statements by making correct logical arguments (direct, indirect, by cases)

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- make a clear definition to fit a new concept
- prove a difficult theorem requiring an intricate argument or a deep, original idea

#### Planar Geometry Content:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- write arguments involving the properties of
    * congruence for polygons
    * parallel lines
    * compass and straightedge constructions
    * circles
    * Euclid’s conception of area

#### Oral Communication:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- present ideas clearly with precision about mathematics
- handle questions respectfully and directly
- ask questions respectfully and directly

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- Make effective use of presentation technology (chalk, computer, other)
- engage in meaningful critique

#### Written Communication:

*Foundational Proficiencies:*

- write in clear English prose
- use proper mathematical style
- use language with precision and care
- effectively construct and use figures
- produce professional quality documents
- read new mathematics for understanding

*Advanced Proficiencies:*

- write concisely, balancing clarity and brevity
- critique written mathematics critically in a peer review setting

***

Students who wish to pass the course should demonstrate mastery of the
foundational proficiencies. To earn a higher grade, a student must demonstrate
mastery of some portion of the advanced proficiencies.

### The Assessment Process

Assessment comes in a variety of forms, but there are only two for us to be
concerned with: _formative_ assessment where I help you evaluate your learning and
pick a path to improve, and _summative_ assessment where I decide at the end of the
course to what extent you have demonstrated mastery of the course goals and use
that information to assign grades.

From your point of view, formative assessment will play into the kind of feedback
you receive from me and your classmates. (From mine, formative assessment is how
I gather such information and use it to guide the development of class. This will
likely be invisible to you.)

#### Formative Assessment: Feedback on Your Work

I will be keeping track of what goes on during class to the best of my ability.
After each presentation, the class will have a conversation about your work:
this is your primary source of feedback. Sometimes, I may send an email
with some extra comments about your progress. I think of this mostly as a
_formative_ assessment. It is a way for me to gauge your progress and help you
focus on improving your work.

Through the journal process, you will receive referee reports on your submitted
papers. These are the equivalent type of feedback on your written work.


#### How Summative Assessment Works

I will use the following things to assess your work this term:

- Published papers derived from your work and class presentations.
- Reports you write while serving the class journal as a referee.
- Reflective self-assessments you write at conference times.

At the end of the semester, you will collect all of these things into a portfolio.
I will use the contents of your portfolio to set your semester grade.

Each individual item you produce contributes to my understanding of your learning.
I will make available detailed and clear <strong>specifications</strong> for what
constitutes acceptable work. Most of our class time will be spent doing and discussing
mathematics, so the way to meet the specifications will become apparent as we go.

#### The Portfolio Assignment

Students who wish to earn a grade of D or better must turn in a portfolio assignment
at the end of the term.

##### Specifications for the Portfolio Assignment

To be considered for credit, a portfolio must:

- Have a short cover letter (a page or less, typed) which indexes what documents
  are in the portfolio.

- Be organized into sections, in this order:

  * Published Papers and "works submitted", in chronological order

  * Papers Refereed: A copy of each original submission refereed and the referee
  report generated, in chronological order

  * Reflective Self-Assessments

  * Final Examination Tasks

- Contain only items that have been deemed finished.

- Be bound together in a reasonable fashion.


#### Published Papers

The normal mode of work for this class leads to publication of your work in the
class journal. Specifications for this work are as follows:

- The mathematics presented must be complete, correct, and clearly presented.
- The article should follow conventions for mathematical writing as detailed in
the [Style Guide for the journal]({{site.baseurl}}/writing/style-guide.html).

#### Referee Work

As part of the journal process, you will serve as a referee for the work of other
students. The specifications for referee reports are listed in the
[Instructions for Referees document]({{site.baseurl}}/writing/instructions-for-referees.html).

#### Reflections & Conferences

To facilitate the communication process, we will schedule regular conferences
to discuss your progress. You will meet with me for a ten or twenty minute appointment
at three points during the term. The first meeting is the longest, and that is
too much work for me to really get done in a single week, so I will divide the
class into two parts. The first group will meet with me during weeks 3, the second
group will meet with me during week 4. I will meet with the whole class during each of
weeks 7 and 12.

To give these meetings some substance, I require that you write a one page
reflection and either bring it to our meeting or email it to me beforehand. The
point of these reflections is for you to engage in an honest self-assessment. This
is an important part of learning and growing!

- [Reflection Prompt #1][prompt1] (weeks 3 and 4)
- [Reflection Prompt #2][prompt2] (week 7)
- [Reflection Prompt #3][prompt3] (week 12)

Of course, you are welcome to come by and talk about mathematics, or your
progress in the course, at any time I am available.

### What is Typical?

I have taught this course a great many times. The clearest thing I can say about
assigning grades is this: I know approximately what the work looks like at each
grade.

#### What does an A look like?

A student who earns an A has typically published about ten papers, at least one
of which contains something really amazing: something showing a beautiful insight,
real perseverance, or extreme cleverness.
(By the way, extreme cleverness usually lies underneath a huge pile of work.)
This student has also been the referee for several papers by peers.

Such a student usually has shown some intellectual leadership, and has demonstrated
some of the "advanced" levels of proficiency in more than one standard.
This student's final exam paper has solid work on all of the tasks assigned.

#### What does a B look like?

A student who earns a B has typically published five or more papers, and has
demonstrated competence in all of the "foundational" standards, and at least one
of the "advanced" standards. This student has also refereed a few papers by
peers. This student's final exam paper has solid work on most of the tasks assigned.

#### What does a C look like?

A student who earns a C typically has published more than one paper, and has demonstrated
proficiency with all of the "foundational" standards, though those performances
may be uneven enough that at the close of the semester I am not certain all those
standards have been mastered. This student may or may not have been a referee.
This student's final exam paper successfully navigates only one or two of the tasks
assigned, and shows a lack of understanding on the others.

#### What does a D look like?

A student who earns a D has typically published only one paper, usually very late
in the term. I lack confidence in the fact that such a student has a good grasp of
the "foundational" standards. This student's final exam paper perhaps has one task
successfully completed, but the others show a serious lack of depth.

#### What does an F look like?

A student who earns an F has usually taken an extremely passive approach to the course.
This student may have a publication of dubious quality, or none at all. This student's
attendance is spotty, and participation on days present is almost non-existent. This student's
final exam paper demonstrates an inability to complete the most straightforward tasks.
