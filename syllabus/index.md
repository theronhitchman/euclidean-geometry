*Euclidean Geometry*<br />
*Math 3600, Fall 2016*


##Course Description:

This course is devoted to classical, planar geometry, including basic properties
of triangles, circles, quadrilaterals and other polygons, compass and
straightedge constructions, and the notion of area.

Students who complete this course will learn to work _as a mathematician does_.
To meet this challenge, we will run class as an [Inquiry Based Learning][IBL] (IBL)
environment.

Successful students will be proficient in working with axiomatic arguments, and
will improve their abilities to construct, read, write, present,
and critique mathematical proofs. Students will gain insight into the nature and
role of definitions and the process of mathematical work. Students will also
learn something about how to ask and answer their own well-formed mathematical
questions.



##Basic Information:

- Instructor: 		Theron J Hitchman
- Office: 		327 Wright Hall
- Office Hours: 	weekdays 2-3 pm.

  Check this regularly. Lots of important things are at this page.

## Materials:

- Text: [Euclid’s Elements][GreenLionPress], Heath translation,
Green Lion Press, 2002, ISBN 1888009-19-5.
- Software: GeoGebra is a free, open-source geometry program. [www.geogebra.org][ggb].
- Drawing Tools: You may wish to use a compass and straightedge set. If you do,
I recommend a “modern compass” that may be fixed at a given radius.

## Assessment:

Grades in this course are determined by the instructor's evaluation of student progress
towards stated course goals. Evidence will be collected throughout the term in a
variety of assessments, with emphasis on the first two items:

- class participation, focusing on finding and presenting arguments, and publishing in the class journal
- work as a referee for the class journal
- three reflective self-assessments
- a week-long, take-home, final examination

More details and an uncomfortable amount of discussion is available at the course
web page under [assessment][assessment].

If you feel uncertain about your progress in the course at any time, please contact me.

## Dates to Observe:

- Week of September 5 - 9: First self-assessment conferences
- Friday, September 30: Midterm formative assessment, in class
- Week of October 10 - 14: Second self-assessment conferences
- Week of November 7 - 11: Third self-assessment conference, portfolio check-in
- Friday, December 0: Final class meeting. Final Examination distributed
- Thursday, December 15: Final Exam and Portfolio due at 5pm
