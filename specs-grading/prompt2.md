title: Reflection Prompt Two

Before our scheduled meeting during the sixth or seventh week of class, please
write a one page reflection as indicated below. I expect you to bring this
document with you to our meeting, or to email or share it with me electronically
before our meeting starts.


Consider the list of standards for learning that I announced for this course.
(They are available here: [Euclidean Geometry Standards for Assessment Fall 2015][standards])
For each category, reflect upon your progress.

- What are you doing well?
- Where do you want to improve?

Now, prioritize your list of "challenges to improve." Pick one or two items that
are most important to you for your future development.

How can you focus on these things during your work for the next few weeks? Make
a concrete plan for implementing some improvements to your work habits.

### Specifications

To qualify as a passing, your document must:

- Conform to basic standards for English grammar, usage and spelling, with minimal errors.
- Be typed.
- Address the prompt above.
- Focus on critical self-assessment, rather than attempt to convince the reader of
your awesomeness.
- Be submitted before or during your interview appointment with Prof. Hitchman
