Students who wish to earn a grade of D+ or better must turn in a portfolio assignment
at the end of the term.

## Specifications for the Portfolio Assignment

To be considered for credit, a portfolio must:

- Have a short cover letter (a page or less, typed) which explains what grade
the student is applying for, and indexes what documents are in the portfolio.
- Be organized into sections:
  * Published Papers and ``works submitted'', in chronological order
  * Papers Refereed: A copy of each original submission and the referee report generated,
  in chronological order
  * Reflective Self-Assessments
