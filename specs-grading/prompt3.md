Before our scheduled meeting during the third or fourth week of class, please
write a one page reflection as indicated below. I expect you to bring this
document with you to our meeting, or to email or share it with me electronically
before our meeting starts.



Choose one task from the last three weeks of this course on which you have
struggled. In the end, perhaps you succeeded, perhaps not, but please choose
something on which you have spent a significant amount of time and effort.

Think back to how you went about your work. What parts of the process were
ultimately helpful to you and got you closer to understanding the true nature of
things? What have you learned about how to do mathematics that you want to keep?

What parts of your process were ineffective, in that you can see no benefit at
all from working that way? What have you learned about how you have done
mathematics that you need to discard?

Finally, think a bit about how you have grown this semester as a result of your
efforts for this course. Can you identify something you can do now that you
could not do before we started?
