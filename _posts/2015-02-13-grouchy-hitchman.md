title: Sometimes I get grouchy

---

Not many people wanted to present anything today. Mr Maggert tried to fill some time by talking about his ideas for Question F, and Miss Brandenburg took a stab at Conjecture K (Rosie's conjecture).

Mostly, I ranted. The axiomatic method is there to make sure we don't make mistakes. **Every** step should be justified by something we have proved before.

The postulates are there to describe how we can use our basic tools. In particular, postulates 1-3 are all about how a compass and straightedge work.

I have posted task sequence part 5. I hope to see more stuff on Monday.
