Title: First Meeting
---

Excellent work, everyone. Special Thanks to Ms Ahrens for being our first presenter.

We learned several interesting things today:

  * We believe that the first statement of Conjecture 1.1 is true. But we do not
  have a _proof_.
  * We don't believe that the second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is true.
  * _Disproving_ the second statement will require a _counterexample_. We
  have to figure out what would be convincing.
  * We know how to handle a "presentation and questions" cycle.

  * I learned some names! I will forget them promptly and start re-learning them
  next time.

Also, our discussion generated this first class-made conjecture, which I will add
to the list:

  > *Conjecture A:* (Ahrens-Goedken) The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is
  > true exactly when ABCD is a square.

Okay, it is time to get to work. Go prove some theorems and bring them to class.
We will test our arguments out on our peers next time.
