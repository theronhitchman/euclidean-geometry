title: A Very Productive Day
---

This is our thirtieth meeting. So, the term is about seventy-five percent done.
That strikes me as _crazy_. We have so much left to do! But, if you look back, you
have done so much already.

Hawkins worked on Question P, trying to resolve the difficulty between is two
presentations on Conjecture 3.4.

> **Theorem:** (Hawkins) If we add the hypothesis that the quadrilateral is not
> convex to Conjecture 3.4, then the resulting figure is not a rectangle.

Dvorak provided a counterexample to Conjecture 7.3.

> **Theorem:** (Dvorak) It is possible to construct, with compass and straightedge,
> a pair of non-congruent triangles having the following pieces which are correspondingly
> congruent: acute angle, side, another side.

She also added this to our list of things to work on:

> **Conjecture U:** (Dvorak) Let ABC and DEF be triangles so that angle BAC is congruent
> to angle EDF and both are obtuse, AB is congruent to DE and BC is congruent to EF.
> Then triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF.

Mr Fisher presented on 7.5. His line of attack is to assume that 7.5 is false, and use
7.4 to construct an impossible figure. At this point, we have a figure that looks
impossible, but it needs some work to justify the conclusion.

Herbst constructed a whole family of angles which satisfy the conditions of Question G.
