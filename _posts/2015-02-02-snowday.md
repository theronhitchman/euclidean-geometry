title: Not quite a snow day

Attendance was down a bit today due to the weather, but we still made good
progress.

Miss Bulic finished work on Conjecture 1.2. This turned into a subtle task!
In the end the argument relies on identifying the midpoint, X, of BD as the foot
of the altitude of ABD and CBD, and then noting that A, X, and C are collinear using Euclid I.14.

Miss Manternach took the chalk to show that 2.4 is false. We had some trouble
stating exactly what we want to prove, so we will pick this up again next time.

Mr Maggert then showed us that Conjecture E is a theorem. This creates a neat little pattern where the plane is tiled by equilateral triangles, too.

Current Open Tasks List: 1.3 (I guess we can skip it. Nobody has mentioned it, yet.), 2.2, 2.4 (Manternach is onto something here.), F, G, I.

I have more tasks to try, but I think I will hold them to Wednesday. I want to finish these things first.
