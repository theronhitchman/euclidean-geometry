title: Cases almost closed
---

We began with a long discussion led by Mr Ratz and Mr Cowden on task 4.2. We
learned about a few things:

* One can organize the cases which should be present in Proposition I.7 by
comparing angles. This leads to nine cases, which covers everything. Our real
goal is to prove that eight of the cases are impossible. Euclid handled only one.
Mr Ratz has previously handled another. Today, Mr Cowden handled another four.

* It is important to watch the structure of how one applies a theorem during an
argument. First, one checks that the hypotheses of the theorem are true. Then
one quotes the theorem and says "so now we can deduce that the conclusion is
true, too." It is a common trap to look at a theorem and say, "The hypotheses are
false in my case; therefore, the conclusion is false." This is a logical fallacy.
The only thing you can say is "the hypotheses are false, so I can't use the theorem."

I hope that Mr Ratz and Mr Cowden can handle the last two cases for Friday, and
then write a glorious joint paper.

Then Mr Matthes proved Conjecture 6.1, and Miss Bumann proved Conjecture 6.5. Both
of these went quickly and smoothly.
