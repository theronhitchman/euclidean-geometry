title: Rambling History Day
---

We started today with an excellent question: "What tools do we have that allow
us to conclude the existence of a point we don't otherwise know about?"

The best answer we have is Euclid's Postulate V.

This gave me a chance to tell you some of the history of geometry. I talked about
some of these things and more:

> the parallel postulate, Playfair's postulate, Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky
> spherical geometry (elliptic geometry), hyperbolic geometry, geometries you
> can put on surfaces, Thurston's program to put geometries on 3-dimensional
> spaces.

That took at least a half an hour. I will have to keep quiet for at least two weeks,
now.

Mr Matthes then took a stab at the construction we need for 7.2. This didn't finish,
as I had used up so much time.

At the end of the hour, Miss Kirkpatrick was waiting to talk about Conjecture Q,
and Mr Ratz was waiting to talk about conjecture N.

Go finish up the tasks in part 7. I want to hand out 8 --- but not until we are
done with 7.
