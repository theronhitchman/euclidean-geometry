title: First Day, First Theorem

---

A successful start! We had our first presentation, and we got to practice all
the modes of work we will use for class. Here is a run-down of what happened:

Mrs Day presented work on conjecture 1.1, addressing the first statement.

    Theorem (Day-Davis): Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle ABC is congruent to
    angle ADC.

Mr Rundall took the chalk next, and discussion led to this, which we will add to our list of class conjectures.

    Conjecture A (Rundall): The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is false.

Miss Kirkpatrick then started work on this, but elected to pass the chalk as time expired. I hope to see a fresh attack on this on Wednesday.

I want to reiterate how things will run: You will

  - read Euclid
  - try to complete the tasks I give you
  - do as much work as you can independently
  - avoid sources from outside of class: no other texts, no other web sites

You are free to collaborate, but then we will treat things as professionals do: Joint Credit and Joint Responsibility.
