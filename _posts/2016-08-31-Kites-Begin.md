Another full and productive day of discussion. We began with Miss Van Ryswyk presenting
on an argument for Theorem 1.2. ("Why is that a theorem?" you ask. We saw a proof on Monday.)
She has an alternate argument that depends on constructing the two angle bisectors at B and D,
and then attempting to prove that they are in fact the same line. It seems like there
is exactly one step needing a justification, and it has a pretty decent chance.
I hope we might see a conclusion on Friday.

Then Mr Conger took up Problem 2.3. We had a big discussion about all of this, where
many interesting things happened. Here are the highlights from my notes:

- **Theorem:** (Conger) With a straightedge and compass, it is possible to
construct a kite.

- Mr Merck asked about an interesting example like this one:

![Merck's Kite]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Merk-Kite.svg "Mr Merck's Kite")

- We talked about whether that should be a kite or not, and I think we settled on
it being so. In the mean time, Mr Conger revised his construction slightly, and
we ended up with this observation:

- Mr Merck's Kite should be somewhere in Mr Conger's construction, and it would
require choosing the point C inside the circle AB.

- ** Question D**: (class? I didn't write down who asked.) What choices in Mr Conger's
construction need to be avoided because they lead to _degenerate_ situations?

- **Conjecture E:** (Conger et al) Given segments GH and TJ, and given an angle QRS,
it is possible to make choices in Mr Conger's construction of a kite so that the
resulting kite ABCD has AB congruent to GH, BC congruent to TJ and angle ABC congruent
angle QRS.

When class time expired, Ms Worsfold was waiting to share something about Conjecture 2.5,
as was Mr Phaly. Miss Mitchell wanted to share something on Conjecture A. We will start our
next meeting by checking in with these people and Ms Van Ryswyk.
