We had a successful day. I am really please with how well things are going. You
are making it fun for me to come to work each day.

Today's meeting started with Miss Wulfekuhle tackling Conjecture D. (Which I just
realized never made it on to the official class conjecture page. I will fix that
in a minute.) This went smoothly, and we agreed on this theorem.

> **Theorem** (Wulfekuhle): Let XYZ be a given angle and AB a given segment. Then
> is possible to construct a rhombus ABCD such that angle BAC is congruent to
> angle XYZ using Mr Cowden's method.
