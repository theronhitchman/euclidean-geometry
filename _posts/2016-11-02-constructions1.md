We saw a mix today: first some work on circles, and then the start of work on
our construction golf tasks.

Ms Van Ryswyk shared an approach to 10.1, which didn't work.

Mr Phaly gave a proof of 10.1, which relied on this assumption:

> **Conjecture AE:** (Phaly) Let A, B, C, and D be four points on the circumference
of a circle centered at O. The four angles formed by the rays OA, OB, OC, and OD
taken together make four right angles.

Ms Ahrens presented a 3 step construction for 11.2. This was a bit wobbly, but got
a tiny assist from Ms Goedken. And after a bit of thought, the proof came together.

Ms Van Ryswyk then proved Mr Phaly's Conjecture AE. This might count as the shortest
lived conjecture of the semester.

Ms Cohen gave a four step construction of 11.3 with a proof.

Ms Schmeling gave a three step construction of 11.3 with proof.
