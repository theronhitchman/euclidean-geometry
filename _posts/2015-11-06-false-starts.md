title: False Starts, and Results
---

Mr Spiess proved Conjecture 9.1. Mr Cowden took up 4.3, but more needs to be done.
Mr Rundall started 10.5, but had a crucial gap. Miss Kirkpatrick stated and proved
a theorem of her own devising.

> **Theorem**: (Kirkpatrick) Let ABC be a triangle which is not isosceles. The

> Moreover, these lines meet at a point on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

We discussed a source of trouble in Euclid's axiom system: He never states that
there is a _unique_ line through each pair of points, but he clearly assumes so
all the time. We decided to go with him on this, so we will read Postulate 2
as if it had this assumption in it.

Mr Sorensen proved 9.2. Mr Cowden took up 4.4 with respect to Euclid III.1: Euclid
abuses the notation a bit in this argument. The point C is meant to help construct
a circle, but later has to also lie on some line, too. He really should have a _new
name_ for this second point.
