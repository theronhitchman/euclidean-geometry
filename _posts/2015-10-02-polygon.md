title: Polygons&colon; Settled
---

Today we had a big conversation about the definition of the word _polygon_.
Miss Bumann brought an adjustment to the originally given definition, and
after about 35 minutes of discussion, things settled down to this:

> **Definition**: Let \\(n\\) be a natural number. An \\(n\\)-gon is a
> figure consisting of \\(n\\) _distinct_ points, called vertices,
> \\(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\\), no three consecutive vertices being collinear,
> and the \\(n\\) line segments, called sides,
> \\(A_1A_2, \ldots, A_{n-1}A_n, A_nA_1\\). A polygon is an \\(n\\)-gon
> where \\(n\\) has not been specified.

Somehow, Miss Bumann managed to start this conversation and then sit down
quickly, so Mrs Day was holding the chalk for large periods of this
discussion.

Then Mr Rundall started a discussion of how to define the _interior_ of a
polygon. We didn't really have the time this needs, so we will pick up again
on Monday.
