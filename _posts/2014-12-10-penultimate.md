title: Day 42&colon; the penultimate day
---

Today Miss Goodmundson completed a construction of three mutually orthogonal circles.
There is still some work to be done to obtain a proper step count, but at least we
know it can be done.

Mr Hawkins presented a theorem addressing Question 10.2:

> Theorem: (Hawkins) In the setting of 10.2, angle AOB and angle A'OB' taken together
> are equal to twice the supplement of angle AXB.

Miss Bachmeier discussed the remaining cases of 12.7 with a clever construction of a
rectangle in just the right place.

When class concluded, Mr Opheim and Mr Fisher wanted to present results, still.

Friday will be our last official meeting. I will bring the final exam with me.

Please complete work on your papers, I wish to publish the final issue of the class
journal by Monday at the _latest_.
