title: Day 35&colon; constructions begin
---

We started construction challenges today. This involved talking a little about how
to count steps (only count the steps where you draw something with the ruler or
the compass) and about which compass we will use (the modern "fixable" compass, not the
ancient collapsing compass).

Mr Opheim took up challenge 11.1, but it needs a bit more time to get sorted out.
He has a construction which uses 4 steps, but the argument supporting its correctness
needs attention.

Mr Fisher took up challenge 11.8. He gave a six step construction of the tangent to a circle
from an exterior point. Miss Hatchett helped to shorten the proof considerably
by pointing out that Fisher was rewriting a proof for Theorem 7.4 as part of his work.
