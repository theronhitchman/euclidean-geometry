We started with a presentation by Miss Schwan on Conjecture 2.4. the result is

> **Theorem:** (Schwan) Let ABCD be a kite which is not a rhombus, then ABCD is not
> a parallelogram.

Then Miss Goedken presented on 2.2, and we fell down a rabbit hole. Her claim was this:

> **Conjecture:** (Goedken) The diagonals of a non-Merck Kite must cross.

During this conversation we found we had been using this result and we are tired of
reproving it:

> **Theorem:** (Folklore) Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB congruent to BC.
If the angle bisector of angle B meets AC at E, then E is the midpoint of AC.

Really, this is the language mathematicians use. A result that everybody knows, but
nobody can remember when it first came up is called a "folklore" theorem.

An interesting thing happened in our discussions: Miss Goedken is trying to use
Miss Van Ryswyk's argument for Theorem 1.2 in this new setting. But, she doesn't have
the language to handle her main assumption, and thus it is difficult to be convincing.
Miss Shere eventually focused the big question down to "How do you know that point E
lies on segment AC, rather than just line AC?" Anyway, we pick up this question:

> **Challenge H:** (class) Give an effective definition for the concepts of
> "Merck kite" and "non-Merck kite." If done well, these definitions should
> allow us to proceed with the proposed argument for Conjecture 2.4, and also be
> the kind of thing that one can easily use to check the "Merck-ness" of a kite.

#### Note

At the end of the hour, we had MANY people waiting to present. We will pick up there
next time.
