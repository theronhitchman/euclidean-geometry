Miss Wulfekuhle presented on 2.2, using the technique for 1.2. We had troubles
brew over the convex/non-convex distinction.

> **Conjecture U (Hitchman):** The following definition is equivalent to our current
one:  "A polygon P is called _convex_ when for each pair of consecutive vertices
X and Y, all the other vertices of P lie on the same side of the line XY."

Mr Ratz solved challenge 11.6 in 4 steps this time.

Ms Kirkpatrick finished Conjecture Q.

Mrs Day gave an approach to 10.5 that uses the incircle and a proof by cases. She
proved her first case.

Mr Sorensen solved challenge 12.4.
