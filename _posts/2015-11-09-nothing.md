Mrs Day proved 9.3. A few other things were suggested to fill our time, but no one
actually took up the chalk.

If we have another empty day like this, I will just start proving theorems, starting
with the oldest ones, but moving steadily through to the newer ones. And I will
**not** prepare, so I will give horrible presentations. So, not only will I be
stealing theorems from you all, I will be boring and confusing.
You have been warned.
