title: Convexity
---

We began with a presentation by Miss Van Ryswyk on Conjecture I. She made an attempt
to argue by cases, but had a subtle gap --- it was not clear that she had covered
all of the possible cases.

Miss Shere then completed her argument on Conjecture 3.4, this time using the
technique of "constructing a copy" instead of "moving a figure to a new place."

Miss Cohen and Mr Conger then continued their dueling presentations on making
definitions of a "Merck" kite. (This is item H.) For this post, I will update the
language to the word professionals use: a Merck kite is "non-convex" where a non-Merck
kite is "convex."

**Definition:** (Cohen Convexity) Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to AD
and CB congruent to CD. Let E be the point where the segment BD meets the line AC.
We say that ABCD is a (Cohen) non-convex kite when E does not lie between A and C.

**Definition:** (Conger Convexity) A kite is a (Conger) non-convex kite when the
vertices which adjoin the congruent sides of the kite are on the same side of
the diagonal created by the vertices which adjoin the non-congruent sides.

Miss Schultz points out that Mr Conger's definition is ambiguous for a rhombus.

We also talked about how the use of some basic notation in Miss Cohen's definition
makes it easier to read and understand. This is what notation is really for.

It is my belief that if Mr Conger's definition was adjusted by introducing some
simple notation, we could address Miss Schultz's concern. Now, this is NOT how I labelled
things in class...

> **Challenge M:** Introduce notation in Mr Conger's definition, and then figure out
what is going on with Miss Schultz's objection.

> **Question N:** Are the notions of a Conger convex kite and a Cohen convex kite
equivalent? State and prove a theorem.

At the end of the hour, Miss Ahrens and Miss Maus were waiting to address item 4.1,
and Mr Phaly was waiting to address 4.3. The other open items are: D, I, J, 4.2, 4.4.

I have posted part 5 of the task sequence, which also introduces some new tasks.
