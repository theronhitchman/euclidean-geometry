More on kites and rhombi today.

Ms Carpenter started an argument for 2.5, but chose to pass the chalk.

Ms Lewis gave a new construction of a rhombus. We took the opportunity to
practice theorem-writing, and came to the conclusion that this is just a
"better" proof of Theorem 1.4. Also, we wonder if we have stumbled on to this:

*Conjecture I:* (Lewis) Given a segment AB and an angle XYZ, it is possible
to construct a rhombus ABCD with angle ABD congruent to angle XYZ using a
compass and straightedge.

The advantage to such a statement is it looks like we can get the entire
family of all rhombi into one unified construction, which would be really cool.

Ms Maass then shared work in the neighborhood of 2.1. She worked with a proof
by contradiction scheme, but the logic was a little tricky to keep straight, and
the statement wasn't so clear at first. So we practiced our theorem writing
again. I cannot stress enough that, "Half a proof is not proof, but progress is
progress." By taking our time and examining what we had in front of us, we
found that Ms Maass has this result:

Theorem: (Maass) Let ABCD be a kite where AB is congruent BC, AD is congruent
DC, and AB is not congruent to AD. Then segment AC is not the angle bisector of
both angle BAD and angle BCD.

Our last discussion was led by Mr Reihman on 2.4. In an amazing turn of events,
his proof had a small gap in it (using Euclid's Proposition I.18 is tricky), but
this gap is perfectly filled by Ms Maass' theorem. I am just astounded at how
well this worked out.

Theorem: (Reihman) Let ABCD be a kite where AB is congruent BC, AD is congruent
DC, and AB is not congruent to AD. Then ABCD is not a parallelogram.

Again, the proof is organized as a proof by contradiction.

### For Wednesday

I am not going to set new tasks for you, as we still have several open
conjectures made by the class we could discuss. We also have not quite completed
our discussion of 2.2.
