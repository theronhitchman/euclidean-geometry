title: Day 21&colon; Walters and Herbst
---

Mr Walters provided more detail to his definition of an angle interior to a polygon,
and we encountered the need for a small theorem to make everything plausible.
Mr Nieman noted that the definition has a claim inside it, and that claim needs
justification! This happens fairly often, and it just needs to be dealt with.

Then Miss Herbst took up Challenge 4.3. We got into a good conversation about how
Euclid uses the word "apply" to sneak in a rigid motion. But rigid motions aren't
in the axioms at all!  

I took the opportunity to share with you that Hilbert's reworking of the axioms for
planar geometry actually take Euclid I.4 _as an axiom_, and not as a theorem. (See
his book _Foundations of Geometry_.) Then we talked a bit more about which
axioms gave the mathematics community trouble, and I mentioned the term _hyperbolic
geometry_.

On Wednesday we will have a short time-out to do the midterm, and on Friday we will
not have class. Enjoy the break and use the extra time to prove some theorems.
