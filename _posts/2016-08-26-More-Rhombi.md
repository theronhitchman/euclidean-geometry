title: More Rhombi
---

Another class moving things forward. We talked about

  1. The Rules about references: Just Euclid's _The Elements_ and our class materials
  2. The subtle error in Wednesday's class: be careful about intersecting circles.
  Use the Postulate in the handout!
  3. We did some math.

Let's talk more about \#3. Miss Goedken presented on Challenge 1.5, and claimed
that Miss Ahrens' construction should be general enough to construct _any_ rhombus,
because we have freedom and flexibility in our choice of interior angle by choosing
point D appropriately.

This led us to a discussion of the true value of mathematical notation. And then I
helped to sharpen the idea into this:

> **Conjecture B** (Goedken) Let AB be a given line segment and let RST be a given
angle. Then it is possible to choose the point D in Miss Ahrens' construction so
that angle BAD is congruent to angle RST.

There was also a short discussion of the fact that the point D cannot be chosen
completely arbitrarily, because there are two special locations which lead to
a "degenerate" rhombus.

Also, Miss Ancona told us that she made a GeoGebra worksheet that does the construction,
and she promised to share it.

Then Miss Maus presented on 1.6. She had a good plan with a solid outline for completing
an argument, but there is a gap in the reasoning related to the diagonals of a rhombus
being angle bisectors. She passed the chalk.

Finally, Miss Cohen took up 1.6. She used a similar outline to Miss Maus, but
avoided the angle bisector business by using some triangle congruence and a mix
of I.28, I.34, and I.13. Also, we had to decided what a rhombus is, because Euclid
never gives a definition.

> Theorem (Cohen): Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then ABCD is a parallelogram.

When class ended, our list still had Miss Bavido waiting for 1.7, and a whole host
of students waiting on 1.2, including Shere, Phaly, Kessel, and Van Ryswyk.

I expect to give you new tasks on Monday. Until then, A, B, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.7 are
still technically open. Find some theorems and bring them with you.
