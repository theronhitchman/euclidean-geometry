title: Mr Maggert's final triumph

---

Today Mr Maggert succeeded in finishing task 4.2. He noted that Euclid's
proof of Proposition I.7 is incomplete because it does not cover all the cases. He made a list of the cases required, and then found a way to handle them.

We noted the corollary that two different circles can meet in at most two points.

Miss Manternach took a shot at 8.3. The scheme of argument here seems sound, but she needs to support this step:

**Conjecture:** (Manternach) Let l, m, n, and o be four lines. Suppose that l and m are parallel, l and n are perpendicular, and m and o are perpendicular.
Then n and o are perpendicular.

Miss Bulic then took on 8.4 again, and got a crucial assist from Miss Van Nevele. This completed that exercise.

I will post set \#9. The current list of open problems is this:
5.2 and 5.3 (non-convex cases, and how do our current arguments use convexity?), J, L, N, O, P, Q, R.
