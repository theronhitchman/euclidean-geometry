We had a productive first day! We spent some time discussing the structure of the
course, but we *did math* and that went well.

First, Mr Maggert was our volunteer guinea pig and gave the first presentation.
From this, we have our first theorem:

> Theorem (Bulic-Maggert) Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle ABC is congruent to
> angle ADC.

This covers the first statement of Conjecture 1.1. We then took up the second half.
Miss Jacobs and Miss Manternach both gave short presentations, but we ran out of
time during Miss Manternach's discussion. We'll start our next meeting with that,
and then continue with whatever other work the class is ready to present.
