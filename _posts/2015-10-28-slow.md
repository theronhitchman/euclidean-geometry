We seem to have slowed lately. We are working through difficult things, but presentations
just don't seem to be closing up. C'est la vie.

Mr Ratz led a discussion on Conjecture N. We decided to have him write it up
carefully, and the we will all get a chance to critique the argument.

Mr Matthes presented on 7.2, but I am still confused. Maybe it is just me. This
is a tricky one to get right, and I think it is almost there, but I wasn't convinced
when we ran out of time today.

During conversation, this came up:

> **Task T**: Find a good definition for the phrases "points A and B lie on
the same side of line l", and "points A and B lie on opposite sides of line l."

At the end of class, Mr Sorensen and Mr Rundall were waiting to present.

#### I will post part 8 right now!
