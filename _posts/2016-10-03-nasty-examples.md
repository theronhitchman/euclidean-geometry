title: Nasty Examples
---

We started with 20 minutes of work time in pairs.

We had a quick discussion that Challenges U and X are "easy" if we reorganize
the work of Miss Goedken and Miss Cohen appropriately. Miss Goedken's work on
Conjecture 2.2 should be phrased as being about the extended diagonals of a kite.
Then Miss Cohen's definition can use the fact that A, C, and E are collinear to
justify using the use of betweenness of those points.

Miss Schmeling presented joint work with Miss Mitchell on Conjecture P.

> Let P be a polygon. We say P is non-convex when there exists a diagonal which
lies outside P.

We spent some time trying to break it. This led to a conversation about the
definition of "polygon." We decided that we must have \\(n\geq 3\\).

We also had a discussion about the words "inside" and "outside." We looked at Phaly's
definition and Goedken's example. I pushed you all by drawing other examples and
lots of rays exiting weird points. You all hated my examples.

Eventually we settled on requiring that polygons have all of their vertices distinct.
