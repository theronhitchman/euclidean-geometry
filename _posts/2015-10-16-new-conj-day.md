title: New Conjecture Day
---

Well, we had a busy day considering the number of presentations volunteered at
the start of class.

We began with a presentation by Mrs Day and Mr Sorensen on Conjecture 7.2. Their
work handles the special case of when the points A and D are equal and when the
points B and E are equal. But it is not, yet, clear why that should be the case.
We had a bit of a disucssion, and Mr Matthes suggested "constructing a copy."
We hope to see more on Monday.

Miss Kirkpatrick proved conjecture 7.4.

During our discussion, we had a new conjecture come up. Miss Bumann proved
it, and then I challenged her (and everyone else) to find theorems in this
neighborhood.

> **Conjecture O (Sorensen)**: Let ABC be a triangle with AB congruent to BC. Let
> M be the midpoint of AC. Then BM bisects angle ABC.

> **Conjecture P (Bumann)**: Let ABC be a triangle with AB congruent to BC. Let
> M be the midpoint of AC. Then angle AMB and angle CMB are right angles.

Both of these are now theorems due to Miss Bumann. Miss Bumann, I suggest a single
paper with both arguments in it.

> Conjecture Q (Kirkpatrick)**: Let ABC be a triangle. Then ABC is isosceles with
> AB congruent to BC if and only if any two of the following coincide:
>   - The angle bisector at B
>   - The median from B
>   - The altitude from B
>   - the perpendicular bisector of AC

> **Conjecture R (Rundall)**: Let ABC be a triangle. Then ABC is isosceles with AB
> congruent to BC if and only if the medians from A and C are congruent.
