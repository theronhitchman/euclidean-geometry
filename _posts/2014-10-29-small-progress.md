title: Day 27&colon; polygons are haaaaaard.
---

Mr Fisher addressed Question 5.1.

Mr Raymond took up 6.6, but there is still a small gap in the explanation. The observation
is that the base angles are twice the apex angle of that isosceles triangle.

Mr Nieman led a bit of a conversation on Hawkins' approach to Question T, thinking
about when the new point lies inside the original polygon. This is technical and
messy. In the end, there was more work to do for complicated figures.
