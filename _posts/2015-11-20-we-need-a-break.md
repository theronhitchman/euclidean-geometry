Today's activity:

Mr Matthes solved Challenge 11.8 in 6 steps.

Mr Rundall attempted to solve challenge 11.3 in 3 steps, but it didn't quite work.

Mr Ratz finished 4.1! This was great to have finally done. It built upon Miss
Kirpatrick's work on E. (I think some credit should go to Miss Wulfekuhle, too.)
The new key step is realizing that in Mr Ball's _unwritten argument_ there is a
mistake to be found if you draw the figure yourself carefully.

Then Hitchman shared the basic idea for a solution to 10.1. (Draw segment AB' and
then use I.32 on the angles of the triangle AXB'.)
