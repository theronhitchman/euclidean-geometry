title: Catching Up A bit
---

We have two days to log.

On April 22, we had four presentations.
- Miss Rehnstrom completed 10.7.
- Mr Gebel found 5 cases in 12.7, but does not yet have a construction for any
of them. In discussion, we found one more case (the circles are equal).
- Miss Manternach presented 13.1.
- Mr Maggert gave a proof of his construction, completing challenge 11.7.

On April 24, Miss Freking presented 13.8. This was our first new theorem on
figures of equal content, so it took some thinking. The main tool was Euclid III.35.
That is an amazing theorem. We spent some time trying to take it apart, and found
that the main point was hiding in II.5.
