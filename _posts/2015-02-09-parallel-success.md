title: Parallel Progress

---

Today saw several new theorems, and the near completion of the third part of our task list.

I have posted new tasks to try to keep up.

Miss Freking gave an argument for Conjecture 3.3.

> **Theorem:** (Freking) The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and
> bisect each other.

Mr Baker took on Conjecture 3.4.

> **Theorem:** (Baker) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral such that angles ABC and
> ADC are right angles. If segments AB and CD are congruent, then ABCD is a
> rectangle.

Mr Schulte proved the Conjecture 3.6, which is often called _the midline
theorem_.

> **Theorem:** (Schulte) Let ABC be a triangle, D the midpoint of AB and E
> the midpoint of AC. Then the line DE is parallel to the line BC.

Then Miss Brandenburg started to tackle part of Question G. We ran out of
time, so we'll pick up at this point on Wednesday.
