title: New Definitions

We began with Mr Ratz discussing item 4.2. It seems that this is a
challenging
thing to get completely correct. I think we have narrowed down on the
existence of four cases. Better, we have leads on trying to describe those
cases, so perhaps we can be sure that we have _all_ of them. One method
at our disposal is to compare angles at the vertices A and B. Another
method that seems viable is to look at when the segments AD and BD cross
sides of the triangle ABC.

Mr Rundall then took up Task M. He desired to split polygons into two
classes. After much discussion, led by Mr Rundall and Miss Kirkpatrick.
This took a good long time, but eventually we settled on something like this:

> **Definition**: (Rundall-Kirkpatrick) A polygon is called _simple_ if for
> each pair of sides, those sides can meet only at a common endpoint vertex.

Then Miss Kirkpatrick shared some ideas for a different definition. She
acknowledged up front that this depends upon getting a reasonable definition
of the phrase "a point X lies in the interior (or in the exterior) of a
polygon P."

> **Definition**: (Kirkpatrick) We say a polygon is _convex_ when all of its
> diagonals lie inside the polygon.

> **Definition**: We say a polygon is _not convex_ if some part of some
> diagonal lies outside the polygon.

I have posted part 6 of the task sequence. I expect that we will finish up
definitions of "interior" and "exterior" some time this week, and that sections 4
and 5 will close up soon.
