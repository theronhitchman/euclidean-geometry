title: Section 6 &colon; DESTROYED

---

Wow. A lot of stuff got done today. Here is an abbreviated recap:

Miss Hegewald presented on 6.1. She proved the conjecture.

Miss Freking presented on 6.2. She proved the conjecture.

Mr Stuhr presented on 6.5. He proved the conjecture.

Miss Brandenburn presented on 6.3. She wished to disprove the conjecture. We discussed this,
and eventually came to the conclusion that it is possible to make a counterexample. But **It is best to actually construct a counterexample.**

Mr Schulte took up 6.4. It got a little stuck at one point. Miss Hegewald took over. She constructed an explicit counterexample and disproved 6.4. We took some time to do an autopsy on Mr Schulte's argument. Most attempted arguments fail. It is best to try to learn from them.

Miss Rehnstrom presented on 6.6. She claims that angle CAD should be half of angle ACD. We did not have time to complete the argument.

After class, I took a careful census of the set of open problems. I believe this is the current list:

* 4.2 (about Euclid I.7)
* 5.3 (about the exterior angles of a hexagon)
* 6.6 (I think Miss Rehnstrom has this in her sights) and 6.7
* I, J (which will require just a bit of attention past what Miss Jacobs has found), L, O

At this point, I think we should call Question N closed. We got two reasonable responses last time. Sorting out their differences and similarities is now Question O.

I will not post a new problem set at this time. I want you to try to finish up some of these loose ends. If we can close three or four of them on Friday, then I will post a new problem set.
