Today I shared a neat theorem, without proof, just for fun.

Mr Ratz proved theorem 8.1.

Mr Matthes took a stab at 8.4, but passed the chalk.

Miss Kirkpatrick shared some definitions for Task T. The relevant bit was something
like

> Let A and B be two points not lying on a line l. We say that A and B lie on
> the same side (opposite sides) of l when the segment AB does not (does) meet l.

Mr Spiess started to present on 8.4, but he, too, passed the chalk.

#### For Wednesday, 4 November

Prove some theorems!
