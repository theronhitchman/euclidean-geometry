title: Finishing Sec 7
---

Mr Matthes finished 7.2, the hypotenuse-leg triangle congruence theorem by completing
the construction idea he had.

Mr Sorensen presented a counterexample to 7.3. We had a short discussion about
what theorems might lay about in this neighborhood. We didn't state any formal
conjectures, but if this strikes your fancy, please do something interesting and
share it.

Mr Sorensen presented on the "If ABC is isosceles then..." direction of Conjecture Q.
At this point, the only remaining part of Q is this:

> Let ABC be a triangle. If the angle bisector from A and the median from A
> coincide, then ABC is isosceles with AB congruent to AC.

Mr Rundall presented work on his Conjecture R. I was pleased to see a theoremI had not
seen in this course before.
