# Welcome to Euclidean Geometry

This semester we will study classical planar geometry. Our emphasis will be on using
an axiomatic approach, based in Euclid's _Elements_ as a way of learning the
processes of how mathematics is done and communicated.

This web site, and in particular this blog, will give me a simple way to communicate
with you about what is going on.

I am excited to get started. See you on the 24th!
