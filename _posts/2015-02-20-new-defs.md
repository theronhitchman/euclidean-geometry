title: New Definitions Required
---

Today we started with Miss Jacobs presenting on Question J. She wants to make a
counterexample. But to do it, we need language to help describe the structure of
things. Our conversation led us to this:

> **Question L:** Find a good definition of "interior angle."

> **Question M:** Find a good definition of "convex pentagon."

> **Question N:** Find a good definition of "point X lies inside polygon P."

Then Miss Hegewald presented on 5.2. We tried to repeat her argument or some
variant of it for the different types of pentagons we made up last time. The sticking
point immediately was Mr Maggert's pentagon.

We split into three groups to try a few flavors of argument:

* Argument 1: Try to use the "new points" X and Y and the triangles they create.

* Argument 2: Round out the polygon and pick triangles out of that.

* Argument 3: Follow Miss Hegewald's argument directly by adding diagonals EB and
  EC and pushing on.

For Monday, we want to discuss the merits of these arguments. Also, I think Question M
is the most approachable of our three new questions. Try to finish that, too.
