title: Another Slow Day
---

Only three presentations today:

Mr Matthes presented on 13.4.

Miss Kirkpatrick solved Conjecture 12.3 in 8 steps.

Mrs Day presented on a "quick" version of 11.8, but this didn't work.

Hitchman presented on some ideas for dealing with measuring total external angles
of non-convex polygons like 5.2 and 5.3. This led me to ramble on about Hopf's
Umlautsatz, the Fary-Milnor theorem, and bridge numbers for knots.
