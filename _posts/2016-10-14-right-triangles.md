title: Right triangles
---

We dug in and proved several new things about regular pentagons, and we started work
on right triangles.

We started with a presentation by Ms Maus in the neighborhood of 6.4. She proved

> **Theorem:** (Maus) Let ABCDE be an equilateral pentagon with three angles which are
(1) mutually congruent, and (2) not consecutive. Then ABCDE is a regular pentagon.

Then we practiced asking questions. We got these three excellent questions.

> **Question AA:** (Conger) Does Ms Maus' theorem about equilateral pentagons hold
for three consecutive angles?

> **Question AB:** (Mitchell) How many congruent angles are necessary in an
equilateral n-gon to force it to be regular?

> **Question AC:** (Cohen) Suppose an equilateral pentagon has two known congruent angles.
Are there any other sufficient criteria for being regular?

Then Miss Mitchell handled 6.6 by proving that for a regular pentagon ABCDE the
isosceles triangle ADC has angle DAC congruent to half of angle ADC.

Then Miss Shere and Miss Goedken gave slightly different constructions for 7.1.

Miss Schultz proved Conjecture 7.2, which is commonly known as "Right-angle-side-side"
or "hypotenuse-leg" congruence for triangles. Note that her work used the idea of
constructing a copy like we saw earlier in the term.

Then, Miss King sprinted through the end of class to share her proof of Conjecture 7.4

### Open Questions

The current list of open questions is:

  * 1.3 and 4.4 (ha ha)
  * 6.7, 7.3, 7.5
  * D, J, O, Q, T, V, Y, Z,
  * AA, AB, AC as above.

Since we are running low on "official Hitchman questions" I have posted part 8 of the
task sequence. I hope you enjoy it, it is about this basic question: Where is the
center of a triangle?

### Current List of Referees

I got asked after class for a list of the current set of student referees. Here is my
official list:

        Mitchell, Bavido, Cohen, Worsfold, Maus, Shere.

I expect to add a few more in the next week, as there are papers I need to referee
waiting for me.
