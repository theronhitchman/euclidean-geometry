Back from our break!

The list of volunteer presenters was empty, so I made up some stuff to do on the spot.
First, we broke into two groups and worked on proving that our two definitions of
"point X lies inside polygon P" are equivalent.

After some work, we realized that they are NOT equivalent. This started a conversation
about where to go... and we ended up choosing the definition using parity (even/odd) as
a basis because it was simpler.

Then we started a similar project for our two definitions of convexity.

One of those definitions got a little tweak to make it more clear:

> **Definition:** Let P be a polygon. We say P is _convex_ when for each diagonal
> of P and for each point X on that diagonal, X lies inside P.

We didn't resolve this, yet. But we did get this interesting thing:

> **Conjecture Q:** (Baker) Let L be a line and let X and Y be points lying on the same
> side of L. If Z is a point on the segment XY, then X and Z lie on the same side
> of line L.
