title: New Questions

---

Well, a *lot* happened today.

Mr Gebel took the chalk to start a discussion on 1.5. He had a bit of a
challenge in formulating a firm answer because you have never been asked to do
this kind of thing before. The key is that a mathematician answers a question by
finding and proving theorems. So we looked for what might be solid theorems we
could state.

> **Conjecture E:** Given a segment AB, Mr Baker's construction produces exactly
> one rhombus, up to congruence.

Then Miss Brandenburg gave an alternate construction of a rhombus, hence a new solution to Challenge 1.4.

> **Question F:** Is it possible to use Brandenburg's construction and specify
> an arbitrary angle of the rhombus? (Is any angle possible?)

> **Question G:** Do any pairs of choices of point C lead to congruent rhombi?

Now, finishing those three items will give a pretty complete understanding of
the collection of rhombi. Let's call 1.5 closed, since now it has morphed into these three new things.

Then Miss Bulic took up Conjecture 1.2. She has a clever attack that involves
using the altitude of one half of the rhombus. There are steps that need
justification. A major step seems to be:

> **Conjecture H:** Let ABC be an isosceles triangle. Let X be the foot of the
> perpendicular line from A to BC. Then X is the midpoint of BC.

It looks like there is a path through this way, but it is not done, yet.

### Open Problems List:

The list of currently open problems is below. I have noted where we have made
some progress, or where someone has indicated they would like to make a
presentation.

* 1.2 (with an approach by Miss Bulic),
* 2.1 (perhaps Miss Hegewald), 2.2,
  2.3 (Mr Stuhr), 2.4,
* D (Miss Jacobs), E, F, G, H
