We began with Mr Baker presenting on Question F. His work can be prepended to
what Mr Maggert did on Friday to close the question.

Miss Barbaresso handled Task 5.1. Note that part of the trouble in many mathematical
definitions is that some choices must be made, but we wish for the end result to
not depend upon these choices in any essential way.

Miss Rehnstrom took up Task 4.1. She found that the main line of argument in Prof Ball's
paper is wasted energy, because the point E he constructs _never_ lies inside the triangle.
(This was an observation based on a GeoGebra sketch.) It still remains to see if the other
parts of his argument, which are conveniently swept under the rug, have gaps in them
or not.

Miss Hegewald then took on Question 5.2. She gave an argument that the exterior angles
of a pentagon must together make four right angles.

Then we took time to explore different kinds of pentagons. We had a few crazy examples
on the board at the end of the hour: regular, home, t-rex, pacman, and Maggert's. These
forced some new questions on us.

* Can an exterior angle actually lie inside the polygon? (eg. pacman and t-rex))
* Is Maggert's example really a polygon?
* If so, how many vertices does Maggert's example have?

Lotsa stuff to do...
