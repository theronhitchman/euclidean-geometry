title: Spring Break Catching-Up

---

It is the middle of Spring Break. I have spent some time sleeping, and now it is time to start catching up on work. So, this is a post to cover Wednesday and Friday from just before break. I will take papers with me on my big road trip and return as many of them as I can on Monday.

By the way, don't turn in any more papers directly to me. I will have NEW INSTRUCTIONS on Monday.

Mr Maggert tried to give a new definition or two. He is trying to find a clever way around our troubles with interior and exterior angles. Eventually, we realized that his condition is a "global" one, and it really needs to be "local."

I encouraged him to work on this, but not to lose sight of the real issue in Task 4.2: Euclid's argument is incomplete, but it can be completed.

Miss Freking took on Conjecture 7.2 anew, by attempting a construction instead of using a motion. This is a good idea. But it is not clear yet how her constructed object triangle ABX is congruent to the second of the given triangles DEF.

Miss Rehnstrom presented on question I. She proved two theorems. Each gives a construction of a kite with two given (unequal) sides, one with a given angle between a pair of congruent sides, the other with a given angle between a pair of non-congruent sides. This basically obliterates this question.
