title: A Big Theorem
---

Wow, we had big results today. First, Miss Bavido presented on Conjecture 1.7.

> Theorem (Bavido): If the diagonals of a rhombus cross, then they do so at right
angles.

The we had several presentations about Conjecture 1.2. Miss Shere gave a very clever
argument using Postulate 5. Mr Phaly claimed to have essentially the same argument.

> Theorem (Shere): Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then AC and BD intersect at a point
inside the rhombus.

Mr Kessel had a different approach using a midpoint of one of the diagonals somehow, but
it didn't quite close up. During Mr Kessel's presentation, Mr Pint asked the
following interesting question, which we add to the list [here](http://theronhitchman.github.io/euclidean-geometry/class/):

> Question C: (Pint) Is it possible to construct a "perfect rhombus?" That is,
is it possible to construct a rhombus ABCD so that AB is congruent to AC?

Miss Van Ryswyk took a similar approach, but we ran out
of time to discuss the details. We will start there next time.

Our current list of open tasks is as follows: Conjecture A, B, and C. Challenge 1.3.
I expect those to get finished soon, so I have posted the next section of the
task sequence, which can be found
[here](http://theronhitchman.github.io/euclidean-geometry/tasks/).
