title: Up and Down

---

Mathematical work is just like any other intellectual work: you will have
ups and downs. One secret to surviving the process is living by this mantra.

> "Half a proof is no proof, but progress is progress."

By looking for a way to package what work you have done, you can often take a
lot of positive things out of work that otherwise failed your original goal. We
will see this over an over again this term. If you don't quite get what you wanted,
don't give up! Instead, see what you can repackage from your arguments. This way
we keep moving forward.

We began our meeting with Miss Davis presenting a very clever use of Postulate V
to attack Conjecture 1.2.

> **Theorem (Davis)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then ray AC meets ray BD.

This is not quite the whole of Conjecture 1.2, since the conjecture asks for
_segments_ AC and BD to meet, not the rays. So, we still have this question:

> **Question E (Davis)**: We know by Davis' theorem that the diagonals of a rhombus
> meet if "produced indefinitely." Must the intersection point X lie on the segments
> AC and BD?

Then Miss Bumann took up Conjecture 2.1. We had a long conversation here. First,
Miss Bumann tells us that she thinks that 2.1 is generally false, but part of it
is true. She also proposed a rigidity theorem much like the one we are working on
for rhombi. We ended up with three outputs. First, a theorem.

> **Theorem (Bumann)**: Let ABCD be a kite with segment AB congruent to segment
> BC and segment AD congruent to segment DC. Then angle BAD is congruent to angle
> BCD.

Next, this conjecture about the other pair of angles.

> **Conjecture F (Bumann)**: There is a kite ABCD with segment AB congruent to
> segment BC and segment AD congruent to segment DC such that angle ABC is _not_
> congruent to angle ADC.

And finally this rigidity conjecture.

> **Conjecture G (Bumann)**: If ABCD is a kite and both pairs of opposite angles
> are pairs of congruent angles, then ABCD is a rhombus.

Our third presenter for the day was Miss Kirkpatrick. She took on Conjecture C'''.
We were supposed to have a discussion about if all of that mess of related
conjectures was now finished, but did not. I hope that gets discussed next time.

> **Theorem (Kirkpatrick)**: Suppose that ABCD is a rhombus but not a square.
> Then either angles A and C are obtuse and angles B and D are acute, or angles
> B and D are obtuse and angles A and C are acute.

At the end of the meeting, we still had Miss Wulfekuhle and Mr Rundall waiting to
present on Tasks 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. You should take those up next time.

Oh, and my thanks to Mrs Day and Mr Ratz for agreeing to take notes for me on next
week's meetings. I am nervous about leaving you alone so soon. It is a bit like
that moment when I let go of my kids bike for that first spin without training
wheels. I am really letting go... I am sure you can ride on without me. Just
pretend I am there.
