title: Fancy Theorems

I was very pleased to see three theorems today that don't always get proved in this
course.

Mr Ratz proved 13.5. Mr Matthes proved 13.6 (often known as the parallelogram law).
And both Mr Rundall and Miss Kirkpatrick proved 13.8. Mr Rundall's version of the
argument is written in modern algebraic style, while Miss Kirkpatrick's would be
more familiar to Euclid and his contemporaries.

#### For Monday, 7 December

Prove more theorems!
