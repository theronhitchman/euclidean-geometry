This post covers the meetings from December 3 and 5.

## December 3:

Miss Benson gave a 13 step construction for Challenge 12.1.

Miss Herbst gave a presentation of 13.1.

Mr Hawkins showed us an idea for 10.4, but it didn't quite work. We hope to see
more progress on this.

Then we took some time to have discussions in class. Eventually, Miss Benson led
a bit of a discussion that ended with a 3 step construction of 11.3.

## December 5:

Mr Scheidecker gave a short proof of item 10.5, assuming that 10.4 is a theorem.

Mr Walters gave a 7 step construction for 11.6 (drawing a parallel line).

Then we took some time to work.

Then Mr Wendt gave a clever attack on 13.5, proving that the square which shares
a right angle with the triangle has half the content of the triangle, but the
square which has a side lying along the hypotenuse has less than half.

Then Mr Nieman asked an interesting question:

> ** Question X: (Nieman) What proportion of the content of the isosceles right
> triangle is covered by the inscribed square with a side lying along the hypotenuse?
