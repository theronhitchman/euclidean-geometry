Ms Van Donselaar presented on 2.3, giving a construction of a kite. We talked
a little about how to write that up, and then had a long conversation around
this particular item.

One particularly interesting feature of the construction that Ms Van Donselaar
pointed out was that her method really produces _two_ kites with a given side
AB. One of them looks like we expect. The other is "odd-looking", in Mr Peter's
words, and seems to have the property that its diagonals don't cross. If that
can be tightened up, we might get a resolution of Conjecture 2.2. We decided to
call such things "boomerangs."

We generated a list of new questions to add to our work:

*Question E:* Is it possible to construct a kite which has no equilateral
triangle? (The Van Donselaar examples all have triangle ABC as an equilateral
  triangle.)

*Question F:* What is an "interior angle?"

*Question G:* What is the "interior" of a polygon?

*Question H:* How do we differentiate between the "normal-looking" and the
"odd-looking" kites? Is there some geometrical way of distinguishing these?

At the end of the hour, we had several people waiting: Carpenter with 2.5, Lewis
with 1.5, and Maass with 2.1.
