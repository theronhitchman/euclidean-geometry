Miss Ahrens took a new approach to 7.4. The basic idea is to extend the sides passing
through C until they meet a circle CA. This should create an inscribed
figure, which she hopes is a square. There is lots to do, still, but the idea
is intriguing.

Then Miss Ahrens shared with us a solution to Conjecture T, noting that the new
definition of _convex_ using the locations of diagonals basically solves the problems.

Miss Bavido then presented proofs of both A.3 and A.5 dealing with some
technical stuff about segment classes.

Miss Mitchell then tried to prove 7.3. The class was just about to accept this work
(we even clapped) when Miss Schultz shared the diagram of a counterexample. We discussed
the gap and what led Ms Mitchell astray, and in the end it was a "reasoning from
the picture" error, and almost exactly the same as Mr Ball's! I invited the class
to find theorems in this neighborhood.
