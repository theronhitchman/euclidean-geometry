title: Nov 3&colon; Right Angles
---

Mr Bieber gave an argument for 7.4:

> **Theorem:** (Bieber-Wendt) Let angle ABC be inscribed in a semicircle. Then angle
> ABC is a right angle.

Mr Wendt then gave a different argument for the same theorem. This second argument
had a small hole in it having to do with the internal angles of a quadrilateral,
but it was very quickly patched using a theorem of Miss Herington.

Then Mr Scheidecker started a conversation about 7.1. The class had a long discussion,
I noted that Miss Dvorak and Mr Hawkins were particularly active in this. In the end,
Miss Westervelt brought things to a conclusion with a good diagram.

I took a look through our list of open items. I note these are open right now:
4.1, 4.2, 6.7, 7.3, 7.5, G, K, P, Q, R, T.
