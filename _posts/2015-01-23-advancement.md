title: Advances in small steps

Wow. What a productive day we had. My notes are really full, so I'll just share
the highlights:

Miss King presented on 1.7.

> ** Theorem:** (King-Van Nevele) Let ABCD be a rhombus and suppose that the diagonals
> AC and BD meet at a point X. Then angle ABX is a right angle.

Mr Baker presented on 1.4.

> **Theorem:** (Baker) Given a segment AB, it is possible to construct a rombus with
> side AB using a compass and straightedge.

Note that this now makes 1.5 a real question. Consider it a thing to do. Then
Miss Hegewald took up the challenging Conjecture 1.2. From her work we extracted this
result.

> **Theorem:** (Hegewald) Suppose that the diagonals of rhombus ABCD cross. Then
> they bisect each other.

Just like the King-Van Nevele theorem, this hypothesis allows us to make progress
while still working on Conjecture 1.2. Once Conjecture 1.2 is settled, we
can update our understanding.

Miss Freking then presented on Conjecture A, and this led to a long classwide conversation
with presentations by Mr Baker, Mr Maggert and Miss Brandenburg. I think the complete
list of outcomes looks like this:

> **Conjecture B:** (Freking) If ABCD is a rhombus, then its four angles taken
> together make four right angles.

> **Theorem:** (Freking) Conjecture B implies Conjecture A.

Miss Freking's statement can be made to sound nicer, surely, but that is the content. When
Mr Baker took the chalk, we ended up with these on the board:

> Statement 1: The four angles of a rhombus taken together make four right angles.

> Statement 2: The three angles of a triangle taken together make two right angles.

And then Mr Baker argued for this:

> **Theorem:** (Baker) If statement 2 is true then statement 1 is true.

Mr Maggert asked this reasonable sounding question:

> **Question C:** (Maggert) Is it true that statments 1 and 2 are equivalent? That is,
> we have a proof that 2 implies 1. Is it possible to use statement 1 to prove statement 2?

Then Miss Brandenburg settled the original line of questioning with this result:

> **Theorem:** (Brandenburg) Statement 2 is true.

Now, that allows us to reorganize things. If this were the professional mathematics
literature, things would have happened on a bit longer time scale, and Miss Brandenburg
would get to write the big final paper with the best sounding theorem. This is called
"good timing." As it is, we shall have Baker and Brandenburg write a joint paper
to encapsulate their quick thinking:

> **Theorem:** (Baker-Brandenburg) If ABCD is a rhombus, then its four angles taken
> together make four right angles.

At this point, the list of open problems looks like this:

1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and Question C.

I will also post the second part of the task sequence when I put up this post.
