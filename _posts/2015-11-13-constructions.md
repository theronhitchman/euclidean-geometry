Mr Spiess presented a new approach to 9.4, which looks like it might be much shorter.
But it still didn't finish, so we will return to it.

Ms Kirkpatrick solved challenge 11.1 in 4 steps.

Mr Rundall solved challenge 11.2 in 3 steps.

Mr Cowden attempted 11.3, but we decided his first step ("make a circle tangent to the line")
is not allowed as an atomic step. This is still open.

Mr Rundall attempted 11.4, but misread the challenge.

Mr Ratz solved 11.5 in 4 steps.

Mr Ratz solved 11.6 in 5 steps.

Still open from section 11: 11.3, 11.4, 11.7, 11.8
