title: More Rambling, and some Actual work
---

I seem to be primed to ramble and talk lately. I started class by talking too much
about old books, the textbook racket, and non-standard analysis.

Then we got back to work.

Mr Spiess shared some ideas with us which were meant to address Miss Kirkpatrick's
question, "What tools do we have for constructing points from nothing?" We had a
good discussion befitting the challenge of this task. In the end, we saw that Mr
Spiess wants something like a "circle-line intersection property", which will
be analogous to the "circle-circle intersection property" in the first set of
notes I gave you. We leave it to him to come up with a careful statement of
this, which will become Conjecture S. I challenge all of you to find a way to prove
this new property from the older one.

Mr Rundall presented on 7.1. We quickly realized that he had a different conception
of the task than everyone else. Before he put the chalk down, he had an idea. Now,
we are giving him some space to work on it.

Miss Kirkpatrick presented on Conjecture Q. She had most of the six parts of "two
of these four objects coincide implies isosceles." It seems that there was one
part she has done but did not, yet, present, and one part she does not claim to have.
The other direction ("if isosceles, then all four of these coincide") is still
unaddressed.

#### Current List of Open tasks

According to my notes, here are the tasks we have not, yet, closed.

* Class Conjectures: E, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R
* OLD Conjectures off the list: Conjecture 1.2 and 2.2. (These seem to be waiting on E,
but maybe there is another way.) Tasks 4.1 and 4.3. Task 4.2 is nearly done. Tasks 5.2
and 5.3 in  non-convex cases. Task 7.1.
* Newer Things that have just sat: Question 6.7, Task 7.3.

Of course, I could be wrong about some of this. Let me know if my notes are incorrect.

If we prove four or more theorems on Monday, I will post part 8 of the task sequence.
