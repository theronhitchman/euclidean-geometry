title: Some Parallels &colon; and &quot;between-ness&quot;
---

We began with a quick discussion on how to handle reading and responding to referee
reports.

Then Miss King proved that Conjecture 3.3 is a theorem.

Mr Merck proved that Conjecture 3.5 is a theorem.

Miss Ancona gave an approach to Conjecture 3.6, but we had two issues:

  - this approach has an assumption that the original triangle has a right angle at B.
  This is fine, it just means we are discussing a special case.
  - Miss Ancona made a claim about an angle that the class wasn't willing to believe.

Miss Goedken claims to also have something to share on 3.6, but I asked her to wait
until Friday so that Miss Ancona has time to think about her approach independently.

Miss Cohen took on Challenge H, and proposed the following:

> Definition (Cohen) Let ABCD be a kite. Let E be the midpoint of segment BD.
> We say that ABCD is a Merck Kite when AC is less than AE.

Mr Conger asked about a situation where the kite is labelled differently than Miss
Cohen's original picture, and we realized this is an issue. Whatever definition we
have, it really shouldn't depend on the labelling of the figure.

Mr Conger then proposed this for Challenge H:

> Definition (Conger) A kite ABCD is a Merck Kite exactly when D lies on the same side
of line AC as B.

From this conversation, we realized that both attempts want some ideas about "between-ness."
So we have the following to add to our list of tasks:

> **Challenge K:** Let A, B, and C be collinear points. What should we mean by the phrase
" B lies between A and C"?

> **Challenge L:** Let \\(\ell\\) be a line and let A and B be points. What should
we mean by the phrase "points A and B lie on opposite sides of line \\(\ell\\)"?

### What's next?

At the end of the hour, we had the following list of volunteers:

    Conger E, Shere 3.4, Maus F, Ancona and Goedken 3.6

The list of remaining open problems is currently:

  * 3.4, 3.6, 3.7
  * D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L
