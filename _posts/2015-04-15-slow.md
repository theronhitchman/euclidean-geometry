So, no presentations today. I made a list of the current set of open tasks, which looks
like this:

    5.2 &amp; 5.3 non-convex cases (and how does that inform our convex case arguments?),
    6.7, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, All of section 12, L, N, O, P, R.

Then we started work. During the conversations, we came across the following things:

> **Porism to Euclid III.1:** The perpendicular bisector of any chord of a circle
> goes through the center of that circle.

This is the final step that Mr Maggert needed to prove that his construction for
11.8 works.

> **Euclid III.16 (first part):** If a line is drawn perpendicular to the end of a
> diameter of a circle, that line is tangent to the circle.

That handles the last needed step in both Mr Henry's construction for 11.6 and the
construction made jointly by Henry and Maggert.

Let's see some of section 12 and then we'll get on to studying _area_.
