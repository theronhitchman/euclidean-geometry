title: Triangle Centers
---

Ms Ahrens presented on 7.5. In the end, her proof (and many others) will need
a _Circle-Line Intersection Postulate_ much like the circle-circle intersection
postulate that we needed back in the first week of class. So we made this assumption.

Ms Cohen presented on 8.3, and structured her argument so as to use this result,
which may be of independent interest:

    Lemma: (Cohen) Suppose that line l meets line m and that lines l and r are parallel.
    Then line r meets line m.

Ms Ahrens presented on joint work with Miss Goedken on a completely different approach
to 8.3. This was new to me, and was very short.

Ms Goedken then presented on 8.4 by breaking the proof up into cases depending on the
location of the point X where the perpendicular bisectors of a triangle meet.

>**Conjecture AD:** (Ancona-Goedken) The circumcenter of a triangle lies
inside/on/outside of a triangle exactly when the triangle is acute/right/obtuse, respectively.

Then Dr Hitchman spoke for a minute on triangle centers.
