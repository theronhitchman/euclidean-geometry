Lots of progress today!

Miss Rehnstrom finished 11.1. 4 steps and a proof.

Miss Bulic and Miss King finished 11.2. 3 steps and a proof.

Mr Gebel gave a presentation on 11.3. 4 steps. proof with a gap.

Miss Brandenburg finished 11.5. 4 steps and a proof.

Miss Jacobs presented on 11.6. 4 steps, but an incomplete proof.

Mr Baker shared that he has found a flaw in his work on 10.5, and showed what the error was.

Mr Gebel adjusted his construction. Still 4 steps, but this time with a proof. There was a really subtle sticking point, but we got it. This finished 11.3

Miss Jacobs gave the proof that finished 11.4.

Mr Maggert gave a 3 step construction for 11.3 and a sketch of the proof that uses an argument by Miss Jacobs we never really settled on. I hope to see one of them finish that thing on Monday.
