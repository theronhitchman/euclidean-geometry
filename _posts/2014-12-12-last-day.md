Today's achievements:

Miss Westervelt proved two theorems not on our original sequence:

> **Theorem:** (Westervelt) The length of the midline of any triangle is half the
> length of the corresponding base.

> **Theorem:** (Westervelt) The midlines of a triangle divide the triangle into
> four congruent triangles, each one quarter of the content of the original.

Mr Opheim presented a construction of 12.2. After some discussion, we decided it
used 7 steps, which is the par value.

Mr Fisher presented 13.8, a method for what is called _the quadrature of a rectangle_.
(_Quadrature_ is old language for "turning into a square"--a quad.) Since it has to
do with area, it often gets used when talking about integration, too.

Mr Griffen presented a different construction of three mutually congruent circles
for challenge 12.4.



Thank you all for a wonderful semester. It has been fun watching you all grow.
