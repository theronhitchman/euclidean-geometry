title: The Conger Circle Show
---

We started with a presentation by Ms Maus on an alternate proof of Theorem 9.3.

Then Mr Conger took up the chalk and led us through some new stuff about circles.
He proved 9.4 and then 9.5.

Then we took a while to work in pairs.

Ms Schwan took up B.3, but the class was not convinced, as the key step felt
unsupported.

At the end of class, Ms Van Ryswyk declared her intent to present 10.1 at our next
meeting.
