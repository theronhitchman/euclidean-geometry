Wonderful! We have lift-off. I am really pleased with the effort you all put forth
before and during class today. We got our first theorem and got to talk about all sorts
of interesting and important things that will be themes for the semester.

Here's a run-down from my notes:

Miss Mitchell presented on Conjecture 1.1. We got to talk about the nature and
role of postulates in an axiomatic system. We identified which book is important
to us for the term, and I got to bad-mouth it a little bit. So, our first theorem
is this:

  > **Theorem** (Mitchell) Each pair of opposite angles in a rhombus is a
  pair of congruent angles.

Miss Mitchell also demonstrated to us a very gracious way of saying, "I do not
know and I would like more time to work on it." Thanks again, Miss Mitchell for
being such a good sport about doing the first presentation. We should note that
she shared a bit of a idea about how to construct a counterexample to the
second statement of Conjecture 1.1, but it involves some odd thing called "degrees"
and some property of angle bisectors.

The Miss Ahrens made a presentation on Question 1.4. We talked about some secrets
to drawing circles on the chalkboard. We discussed the nature and role of definitions
in an axiomatic setting. And eventually we even let Miss Ahrens make her presentation
of a construction recipe for a rhombus. As we go forward (especially with Question 1.5),
we will use Miss Ahrens' construction as our reference.

It took us a long time to get through those two presentations, because we are all
new at this and it takes time to sort out the basics of classroom interaction
for the first week. I bet on Friday we get through four or five presentations instead
of just two. Oh, and we DO have people waiting to share. My plan for Friday is to
pick up where we left off. My notes list these:

    Goedken on 1.5, Maus on 1.6, Cohen on 1.1 and maybe 1.6, Bavido on 1.7

Also, I dropped a bit of a bomb at the end of class. One of our two arguments has
a really subtle hole in it. I want you to try to find it. Here's a hint: re-read
(ahem, read for the first time) the material I handed out that _precedes_ the tasks.

Good Job. Work hard and bring more theorems for Friday.
