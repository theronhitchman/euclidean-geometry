title: Day Two&colon; Logic Troubles

---

We had a big rambling conversation which begun with Mr Ratz presenting some ideas for the second half of Conjecture 1.1. Things got pretty confusing, and we spent a long time trying to get a clear statement of what we might actually prove. By the end of class, we had a new question, and several related conjectures to consider. I will add these to the class list.

>  **Question B (Kirkpatrick-Ratz)**: Is it true that the diagonals of a
>  rhombus are also angle bisectors of the rhombus' angles?

And now the conjectures:

>  **Conjecture C (Ratz)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC is
>  congruent to angle BDC only if ABCD is a square.

>  **Conjecture C' (Spiess)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC is not
>  congruent to angle BDC if and only if ABCD is not a square.

>  **Conjecture C'' (Sorenson)**: If rhombus ABCD is not a square, then
>  angle BAC is not congruent to angle BDC.

It remains to see which of these are true, and to convince ourselves of the relationships between them.

I also harangued you all about the way the axiomatic method works. In particular, any logical deduction you make must be supported by either a postulate, a common notion, or a previously proved theorem. This is the essence of mathematical work, and it is what makes us different from everybody else.

So. Go prove some theorems. It would be awesome to see everyone present successfully by the end of next week.
