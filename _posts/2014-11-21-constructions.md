Mr Opheim gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.1.

Mr Walters gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.4.

Mr Hawkins gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.5.

Mr Nieman discussed his work on Challenge 11.7, which we will not call complete, yet.

> **Challenge W: (Nieman)** Given a circle $\mathcal{C}$ and a point $X$ not lying on
> $\mathcal{C}$, construct a circle $\mathcal{D}$ centered at $X$ and tangent to $\mathcal{C}$.

Then Mr Hawkins discussed some progress toward 10.3. This work is not, yet, complete.
