Mr Opheim gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.1.

Mr Walters gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.4.

Mr Hawkins gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.5.

Mr Nieman discussed his work on Challenge 11.7, which we will not call complete, yet.

> **Challenge W: (Nieman)** Given a circle \\(\mathcal{C}\\) and a point X not lying on
> \\(\mathcal{C}\\), construct a circle \\(\mathcal{D}\\) centered at X and tangent to
> \\(\mathcal{C}\\).

Then Mr Hawkins discussed some progress toward 10.3. This work is not, yet, complete.

Because I like to make sure you have plenty to think about, I will post sections 12
and 13 of the task sequence in a few minutes. Part 12 has "advanced" constructions
in it. Part 13 begins our work on the "theory of content."
