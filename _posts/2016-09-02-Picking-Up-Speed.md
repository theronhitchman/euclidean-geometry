Now you are moving. We had many theorems today, and a few new questions to add to
the list. There was less of me, and much more of all of you. That is how class will
look going forward.

We started with Miss Worsfold proving that 2.5 is a Theorem. Mr Phaly and Miss
Schultz claimed the same argument.

Mr Conger tried to get the class to throw a revolt and choose a new definition
for the word "kite." He lacked support, so the definition stands for now.

Miss Van Ryswyk completed her argument for Theorem 1.2.

Miss Schmeling presented on Conjecture A, but passed the chalk when a step came
came up lacking under questioning.

Miss Mitchell presented on Conjecture A, and completed it. So, now we know it is
a theorem.

Miss Ancona presented on Conjecture 2.1, and this started a bit of a conversation.
We got the following things out of it.

A theorem,

> **Theorem** (Ancona) Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to AD and BC congruent
to CD. Then angle ABC is congruent to angle ADC.

a conjecture,

> **Conjecture F**: (Ancona) with the same hypothesis, generally angle DAB is not
congruent to angle DCB.

and a question.

> **Question G** (class) with the same hypothesis, is it true that when angle DAB is
congruent to angle DCB we must necessarily have that ABCD is a rhombus?

When class ended, our list of waiting students was: Schwan on 2.4, Goedken on 2.2, and
Maus on 2.1.

### For Wednesday

Please continue to work on our set of open questions: Conjectures B through G, and 2.2 and 2.4.
I have also added the next section of our task sequence to the page of tasks. The
new items concern parallelism and rectangles.
