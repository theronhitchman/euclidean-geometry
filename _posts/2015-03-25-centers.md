title: Triangle Centers

---

Miss Freking presented on 7.2, with an altered version of her construction.

Miss Van Nevele presented on 8.2, but her presentation really contained 8.1, too. We have a sticking point to worry over:

> **Question R:** How do you know that any pair of angle bisectors of a
> triangle must actually meet?

Miss Bulic started work on 8.4, which we did not finish before the end of our meeting.

This was an exciting day because we got to see the _incenter_ and _circumcenter_ which are the center points of the circles which can be _inscribed in_ and _circumscribed about_ our given triangle.
