We had a big success today when Mr Cowden finished off the last two cases of Task
4.2.

Mrs Day then presented on 7.1, where the key idea is Proposition 20. This is a
geometric statment of the "triangle inequality." Perhaps you have heard of that?

Miss Wulfekuhle presented on part of Conjecture Q that Miss Kirkpatrick did not
claim last meeting. This is clearly the hardest part of the argument and will
require a new idea. Miss Wulfekuhle had a clever approach, but it did not close up
successfully today.

Miss Kirkpatrick finished a remaining case of Conjecture Q that she did not presented
at our last meeting.

Mr Ratz started a discussion on Conjecture N, where he wants a stronger version of
a definition the word convex so that he can make progress.
