title: Day 30, Finishing some things
---

Mr Maggert finished work on 8.3.

Mr Baker convinced the class of his work on 10.5.

Miss Brandenburg presented on 9.4. Note that the main tools here were some very
powerful results on angles in circles III.20 and III.21. Keep those handy.

Open Problems List:

The current list of open problems is this: 5.2 and 5.3
(non-convex cases, and how do our current arguments use convexity?),
6.7,
L, N, O, P, Q.

I have posted sets \#11 and \#12. Students usually enjoy these. I hope you have
some fun with them.
