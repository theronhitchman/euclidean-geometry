There were seven presentations today. SEVEN! We can do a lot now that we know how.

Mr Kessel gave a proof of Conjecture C.

Miss King attempted a proof of 3.3, and got hung up on something about an isosceles
triangle, and made an assumption about the diagonals. I hope to see this argument
again on Wednesday.

Miss Maus took up Conjecture F, but passed the chalk when asked about whether part
of her argument really required _scalene_ triangles, and how could that be justified.

Miss Ahrens presented on B, but got confounded in her diagram and chose the pass
the chalk.

Miss Goedken proved Conjecture B.

Miss Maus proved Conjecture G.

Miss Shere started presentation on 3.4, but there was some confusion on use of
Proposition I.8. Time for class expired before we could call this done.

### For Wednesday

Keep working. I expect the following presentations on Wednesday:

King 3.3, Merck 3.5, Ancona 3.6, Cohen H, Conger E, and maybe Maus F.

### Current List of Open Problems

Section 3 numbers 3.3 - 3.7, and class conjectures D, E, F, H, I, J. That is ten
separate items!
