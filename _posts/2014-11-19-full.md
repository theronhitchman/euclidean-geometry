We had lots of progress today!

Miss Hatchett gave a 3 step construction for Challenge 11.1.

Miss Herington gave a 4 step construction for Challenge 11.3.

Miss Westervelt gave an argument for 9.5. Then Mr Nieman gave an alternate argument for
the same theorem.

Mr Hawkins found a proof of 10.1 by stoichiometry.

Miss Herbst answered Question K in the negative: "If you try to prove that the diagonals
of a rectangle meet by mimicking the approach for a rhombus using angle bisectors it will
fail." This leaves us with the

**Question V:** How can we be sure that the diagonals of a rectangle cross?
