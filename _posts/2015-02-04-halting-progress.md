Today we had three presentations, and lots of down time to work.

Miss Rehnstrom addressed Question G, and proved her conjecture from meeting 6.

> **Theorem:** (Rehnstrom) Consider Miss Brandenburg's construction of a
>rhombus. If C', B, and C are collinear, then ABCD is congruent to D'C'BA.

Mr Henry then presented on 2.2. Essentially, he repeated Miss Bulic's argument from 1.2.

> **Theorem:** (Henry) The diagonals of a kite must cross.

And Miss Manternach presented on 2.4.

> **Theorem:** (Manternach) A kite is a parallelogram if and only if it is a
> rhombus.

We discussed briefly how this _biconditional_ statement is really _two theorems_ and hence requires two independent proofs.

Still Open: F, G, I. And I just posted Task Sequence Part 3.
