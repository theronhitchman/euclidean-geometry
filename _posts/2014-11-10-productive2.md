title: Nov 10&colon; Galloping Along

This was another very productive day.

Hawkins led us through another discussion of issues related to is attack on Conjecture T
by induction. The main step of the induction needs this statement:

> **Claim:** For any simple polygon with at least four sides, the first diagonal
> chosen by the algorithm
> lies inside the polygon and cuts off a triangle.

We believe this is equivalent to this:

> **Claim:** For any simple polygon with at least four sides, there exists a "first class"
> diagonal which lies inside the polygon.

Here by a "first class" diagonal, we mean one that joins vertices which are separated by
a single common neighbor.

Then Hawkins took us through a proof of these claims by contradiction, and applied it
to his inductive argument for Conjecture/Question T.

Mr Griffen gave a proof by contradiction for Conjecture 8.3. Thus:

> **Theorem:** (Griffen) For any triangle, any two perpendicular bisectors of the
> triangle must meet.

Mr Opheim gave an argument for 8.4, but it has a small gap. This is not quite done,
but I expect Mr Opheim will complete it for our next meeting.

Miss Bachmeier gave a short proof of 9.2.

> **Theorem:** (Bachmeier) Let circles with centers G and O, respectively, meet at
> the two points A and B. Then if angle GAO is a right angle, so is is angle GBO.

Mr Raymond shared his work on 9.4:

> **Theorem:** (Raymond) Suppose that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. Then angle
> CAD is congruent to angle CBD.

That is one direction of 9.4. We still need the other.

The current list of open problems is this: 4.1, 4.2, 6.7, (8.4), 9.1, 9.3, half of 9.4, 9.5;
K, R, U.

I will start preparing section 10 of the task sequence...
