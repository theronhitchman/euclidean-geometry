title: Exam Recap &amp; More
---

We began today with a recap of ideas from the in-class exam. I think the major
take-away points are these:

1. You can't introduce an object in your proof without some justification that it
exists. (For example, if you don't know two segments meet, then you can't just
call for their intersection point.)

2. A proof by contradiction always starts in a standard way. If you have a
   statement "If P then Q", then your proof by contradiction should have the first
   two sentences sound a lot like this:
     > Proof: We proceed by contradiction. Suppose that (P goes here) and
     > (not Q goes here).

   Then your job is to show that these assumptions lead to a contradiction. From
   that, you conclude that the problem is the "Q is false" part, so Q must be true.

3. A statement about the equivalence of definitions is really an "if and only if"
type of statement, and hence requires **two** proofs.

Miss Wulfekuhle shared her diagram for Exam Task 4 with us, because it was pretty
cool.

Then we began our regular work.

Miss Davis had a clever proof for 7.5 that completed the triangle ABC to a rectangle,
and then applied Mr Matthes 3.3.

Mr Ratz shared his idea for Conjecture N. This seems a workable idea, but it needs
more time. (It also seems to have the structure of a proof by contradiction!)

Mr Matthes started a construction to fix the trouble with 7.2. This seems to be
overloaded currently, but there is a lot of promising work here.

Prove some theorems!
