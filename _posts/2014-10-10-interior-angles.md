title: Day 20&colon; interior angles?
---

Today began with a discussion of "interior angle" of a polygon, led by Mr Walters.
The basic idea is to use a ray which splits the angle and build upon the ideas Mr Fisher
used for defining the inside of a polygon. In essence, an interior angle is one that
should be inside the polygon. But the challenge seems to be that it is very difficult
to specify the right ray. Clearly there are two classes of rays, but somehow differentiating
between the two will be key.

Then Mr Nieman took up Question Q, and pointed out that the gap between Miss Herbst's
theorem and the negation of Conjecture 2.4 is exactly _a construction_. How
do we know that we can make a kite which is not a rhombus?

Of course, many of our constructions are flexible enough to allow this. And Mr Opheim's
last presentation on 2.4 did exactly this part.

Right now the list of open problems is this:

  * all of section 4: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
  * Class conjectures G, J, K, M (still), N, P, and R.

I am about to go post task sequence part 5.

We will have an in-class midterm on Wednesday next week. Don't study. (You can't.)
Rather, work hard on class.
