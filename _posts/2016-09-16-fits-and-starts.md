After so many days of unqualified success, it was about time mathematics brought
us down to earth. We had only three presentations today.

Mr Conger addressed Conjecture E. He showed us his method for doing the construction,
but it includes a very unusual way of using a compass in which one _picks it up_
after it has been set and then _draws in a different location_. This needs to be
formally justified, as Euclid's Postulate 3 tells us how to set down a compass
and draw in place.

Miss Shere attempted to construct a proof for 3.4, and again part of the argument
relied on a motion which is not otherwise justified. During discussion, Miss Ahrens
suggested perhaps "constructing a copy" in a suitable location might fix the issue.
I think that has some promise and I hope it works out.

Miss Maus then completed a proof of Conjecture F. The main idea is to break the
situation into a number of interesting cases, and then use Euclid I.18 to turn assumptions
about sides into information about difference of angles.

When class was done, we still had the following waiting to speak:

    Ancona and then maybe Goedken on 3.6, Bavido on K and L, Van Ryswyk on I, Herran
    and then maybe Mitchell on 3.7.

If we have a successful Monday, it looks like I will have to set you new tasks.
