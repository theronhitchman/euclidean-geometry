title: Advanced Constructions, I
---

Mr Schulte completed 10.2 by proving the following theorem:

> Theorem: (Schulte) Let X be a point lying outside a circle centered at O.
> Suppose that a line through X cuts the circle at points A and A', and another
> line through X cuts the circle at points B and B'. Then angle AOB taken together
> with twice angle AXB is congruent to angle A'OB'.

Then Miss Brandenburg found and proved constructions for 12.1 and 12.2. The construction
for 12.1 required 12 steps, the construction for 12.2 required 7 steps.

I have posted part 13 of the task sequence, which gives us a start on studying
Euclid's way of dealing with area. Since his conception of area is a bit different
from the modern one, we will use the phrase "equal content" for Euclid's meaning.
