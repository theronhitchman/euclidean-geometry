I am pretty amazed at the level of creativity this class displays. As a group,
you are doing fantastic work. Clearly you have been working hard and well. I am
pleased and I hope we continue to have such wonderful meetings.

We started our work on the "rectangles" section with five students presenting.

Mr Phaly began with an approach to Conjecture 3.1 that would use Postulate 5.
This relies on a subtle kind of negative logic, and the class wasn't ready to accept it,
yet. I do think this approach has a lot of promise, and I would love to see this
argument completed. The big sticking point is the gap between Postulate 5 and the
following claim:

> **Conjecture I:** (Phaly) Draw a diagram of the kind where ABCD is like a rectangle,
if angles ABC and BCD taken together
are greater than two right angles, then ray BA does not meet ray CD.


Miss Herran presented on an approach to 3.1, but chose to pass the chalk.

Miss Schultz presented on 3.2, but along the way gave a proof for 3.1, too.

> Theorem: (Schultz) A rectangle is a parallelogram.

and then

> Theorem: (Schultz) Each pair of opposite sides in a rectangle is a pair of congruent
segments.

Miss Schmeling shared with us a different approach to 3.1. I would say that it is
similar in spirit Miss Schultz's (and different from Phaly's or Herran's), but
uses a significantly different chain of deduction.

Mr Pint then presented on 3.2. He has a creative approach, but class was nowhere
near ready to accept it, yet. It would be fun to see that come together, but a lot
more work is required.

Then Mr Pint presented on Conjecture C, and answered it in the affirmative.

> Theorem: (Pint) With a compass and straightedge, it is possible to construct
a "perfect" rhombus.

Somehow, we still had 4 minutes left in the hour at this point. Miss Mitchell tried to open
a conversation about "Merck-ness" of kites, and hoped to say something about
having only three interior angles. But then, the term "interior angle" is not defined
at this point. So...

> **Challenge J:** (class) Find a reasonable way to define the term "interior angle"
for quadrilaterals.

### For Monday:

Mr Kessel will present his work on C. Miss King will present on 3.3, Miss Maus on 2.1,
Miss Ahrens on Conjecture B, Miss Shere on 3.4, and Mr Merck on 3.5. I welcome others.

### Open Question List

These are the tasks before us which have not been completed:

  * Section 1: 1.3, which I guess I won't be upset if we skip.
  * Section 2: basically everything undone here has turned into a class conjecture
  * Section 3: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
  * Class List: B, and D through J
