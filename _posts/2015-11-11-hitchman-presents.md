title: Hitchman Presents!

Mr Spiess started a discussion of 9.4 that is based on considering a series of cases.
This will take more work.

Mr Ratz shared an argument for 9.5, which was joint work with Mr Matthes.

Then Mr Matthes shared an alternate proof of the same item.

Miss Kirkpatrick proved 10.7, the theorem of the _broken chord_.

Finally, Hitchman sketched how to prove 1.2. And you all groaned at it. That really
is a hard one.
