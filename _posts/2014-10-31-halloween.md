Mr Scheidecker presented his work on Conjecture 7.2.

> **Theorem:** (Scheidecker) Conj 7.2 is a theorem.

Miss Dvorak worked on task 4.1, but we all need to pay more attention to the cases
where the point E lies outside the triangle. I hope to see more of this on Monday.

Mr Griffen then presented work on regular pentagons which ended up closing 6.6, 6.4,
and giving us another interesting result.

I'll leave the exact technical statement of that last one to you. I think that should
serve as an adequate reminder.
