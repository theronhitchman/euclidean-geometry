Miss Ahrens presented on joint work with Goedken on Conjecture 5.3. This generalizes
Mr Phaly's argument for 5.2.

> **Conjecture Y:** (Ahrens) The exterior angles of a simple polygon  
when taken together are equal to four right angles.

Then Mr Phaly picked up Question Q. He wanted to use some sort of intersection
count for rays based at the vertex in question. This had some trouble at a
polygon that I can only describe as a "block G."  Mr Phaly adjusted on the fly,
and Miss Shere presented a polygon that made trouble for the adjusted definition.

Then Mr Phaly took up Challenge R. The basic idea is to check the parity of intersections
of an exiting ray with the polygon, and use an even/odd split, but to require
that the ray must miss vertices.

> **Conjecture Z:** (class) Show that all rays which do not hit vertices of the
polygon have the same parity of intersection with P.
