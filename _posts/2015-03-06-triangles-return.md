title: Triangles Return!

---

Today we had two presenters for three presentations.

Miss Freking took on Conjecture 7.2. It took a while to nail down the exact details, but then we found the spot that needs more attention. The creation of an isosceles triangle here is very clever, but to do it one must do something inside our axiomatic structure. So... that means the superposition of segments AB and DE is not allowed. There has to be another way, though. The rest works so beautifully, I hope Miss Freking can polish this off.

Then Mr Baker presented on both 7.4 and 7.5. The first argument relied on dividing a right triangle into a pair of isosceles triangles. The second built a rectangle having the given triangle as a half. Together, these theorems make up *Thales' Theorem* which is a beautiful characterization of right triangles.
