Welcome! This is the class blog. I will post here every day after class with a
short run-down on our accomplishments for the day. My purposes are two-fold:

* This will make an _official record_ of what happens each day for me to review.
* This will be your resource if you have to miss a day for some terrible reason.

Typically, a post will **not** be an exhaustive set of notes. Nothing can replace
being in class and taking part for yourself. Instead, I will try to highlight
careful statements of theorems, conjectures, and questions we make in each meeting,
along with proper attribution. That way, you can always look up who proved that
theorem about "isosceles triangles last Wednesday," or the exact statement of
"that lemma that Ms. X proved two weeks ago."
