title: It's Simple! Or Complex!
---

We began with Mr Raymond trying to clean up Conjecture 2.2. I had listed this as
Class Generated Question L. I was out of the room being a grump, so I will take
your word for it that we are done.

Then Mr Hawkins led a long class discussion on potential definitions for the words
simple and complex. Of course, those are adjectives meant to modify quadrilateral.
Miss Herington pushed us to apply them to the word polygon, too. It seemed everyone
was pretty happy with all of this for now, so we will accept these as the official
definitions and see how they work for us.

> ** Definition:** A complex quadrilateral is one for which there exist two sides

and

> **Definition:** A simple quadrilateral is one such that for any two sides, if
> those sides meet, then they meet at a vertex.

We will apply these with "polygon" in place of "quadrilateral", too.
