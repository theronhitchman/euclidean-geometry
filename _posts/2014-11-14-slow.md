We have had so many action-packed meetings lately, this was bound to happen.
We had only one presentation, where Miss Goodmundson showed us the error in Mr Ball's
work, thus completing Task 4.1.

Then we took some time to work on Task 10.1, and to mourn the passing of [Alexandre
Grothendieck][AG].

Also, I handed out copies of the fourth issue of the journal. You can find this in the
usual place on this web site.
