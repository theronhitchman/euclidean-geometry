title: Troubles with kites

---

We didn't have nearly as many theorems today, but you still made good progress towards the study of kites.

Mr Stuhr shared work on 2.3, with a process for constructing kites. But we still need a reason why the two circles in his set-up intersect twice.

Miss Rehnstrom took on 2.4, which she hopes to prove is false. A sticky point was the use of Euclid I.27, when she really needs the "Hitchman double contranegative" of I.27. Anyway, we discussed two approaches to showing 2.4 is false. First, one could follow Miss Rehnstrom and prove this:

> **Conjecture D:** (Rehnstrom) If ABCD is a kite but not a rhombus, then ABCD is
> not a parallelogram.

Alternately, one could just construct a single specific example of a kite which
is not a parallelogram. Of course, Miss Rehnstrom's conjecture is stronger, so we
would still want that if we can get it.

Mr Schulte took up 2.5, and with a little prodding from Miss Dvorak, he proved this:

> **Theorem:** (Schulte) If the diagonals of a kite meet, then they meet at a
> right angle.

Then Mr Maggert took up 2.1 with an off-the-cuff presentation. Things looked structurally much like Miss Rehnstrom's situation for 2.4. We ran out of time at this point, so maybe we will see more next meeting.
