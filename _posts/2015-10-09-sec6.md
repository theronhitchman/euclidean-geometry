title: Getting to the interior
---

A large part of our class was used to discuss Mr Rundall's attempt to define
the interior of a polygon. His work uses several new concepts, and will take a
little time to absorb.

_Mr Rundall, I do think this is worth putting in the literature._

During our dicussion we considered a nasty polygon we decided to name the
"devel fork."

Miss Kirkpatrick still seeks a version of this definition which can be checked
at each particular point. She shared an idea for counting intersections. This
seems confusing at vertices, and Miss Davis suggested just ignoring vertices.
This looks like something that we should think about more.

Miss Wulfekuhle showed that Conjecture 6.3 is false.

Mr Ratz showed that Conjecture 6.2 is a theorem. (Mr Matthes tells us he had the
same argument).

Let's finish section 6 for tomorrow!
