title: Good Progress on Rhombi

---

We had a successful day. I think you can see that the work will do is exacting and the proper
level of precision is challenging. I am really pleased with our progress so far.

Mr Matthes started our presentations. The end result was _two_ theorems:

> Theorem (Matthes, Conj B): Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then the diagonals AC and BD are angle bisectors.

> Theorem (Matthes): Let ABCD be a rhombus. Suppose that angles A and C are obtuse and angles B and D are acute. Then angle BAC is not congruent to angle BDC.

We had a big discussion about where this leaves us with respect to conjecture 1.1b, and also the variants of conjecture C. In the end, we got these this theorem

> Theorem (Rundall): If ABCD is a square, then angle BAC is congruent to angle BDC.

and also this conjecture

> Conjecture C''': Supppose that ABCD is a rhombus but not a square. Then either A and C are obtuse and B and D are acute, or B and D are obtuse and A and C are acute.

I really want to finish this line of thought. I hope you will bring a theorem or two for next time and we can carefully think through which versions of conjecture C we have completed.

The Miss Kirkpatrick presented and we got this result:

> Theorem (Kirkpatrick, 1.7): Let ABCD be a rhombus. Assume that the diagonals AC and BD meet at some point X. Then angle AXB is a right angle.

We are very nearly done with the first set of tasks. I will likely set new ones at the conclusion of our next meeting.
