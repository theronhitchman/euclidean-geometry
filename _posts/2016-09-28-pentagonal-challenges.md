title: Pentagonal Challenges
---

We only had three presentations today, but a LOT happened.

We began with a presentation by Miss Schultz, who shared joint work with Miss Cohen:

> **Theorem:** (Cohen-Schultz) If A, B, C are three consecutive vertices of a polygon
then both exterior angles of the polygon at B will be congruent.

The we started asking questions.

> **Challenge P:** (Bavido-Cohen-Schultz) Find a definition for convex/non-convex for
general polygons.

> **Question Q:** (Mitchell-Van Ryswyk) Should we change the defnition of "exterior angle"?
Can an exterior angle really lie inside a polygon?

> **Challenge R:** (Phaly) Come up with a definition of "the point X lies inside the polygon P."

Then we made some examples of polygons. I took a picture of the board:

> **Challenge S:** Find language to classify these pentagons.

Then Mr Phaly took up item 5.2.

> **Theorem:** (Phaly) Suppose that ABCDE is a pentagon such that inserting the
diagonals BD and BE splits it into three non-overlapping triangles. Then the exterior
angles of ABCDE taken together make four right angles.

> **Conjecture T:** If ABCDE is a convex pentagon, then it is possible to insert diagonals
BD and BE to split ABCDE into three non-overlapping triangles.

The Miss Bavido presented item A.1 from the Trig Supplement.
