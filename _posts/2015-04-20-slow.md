Today's results:

Miss Barbaresso presented on 6.7. We had a short discussion trying to prove her observation that there appears to be only one convex regular pentagon. Then we eventually found a non-convex regular pentagon (the pentagram). Finding a complete proof that this is the only one will require more work on 5.2 and 5.3.

Miss Brandenburg presented 12.3.

Hitchman presented a 3 step solution to 11.4. I later found a three step solution to 11.6. If no one else finds one, I'll share it next time.
