This blog is several meetings behind our class schedule. So here I will summarize
four different meetings and get caught up.


## October 15, 2014

This was our midterm examination day.

## October 17, 2014

No Meeting. (Mental Health Day)

## October 20, 2014

Mr Bieghler presented on Conjecture 5.2. He proved that the exterior angles of a
pentagon taken together make four right angles.

We had to have some discussion then about which definition of _exterior angle_ was
being used.

Mr Walters then gave an argument to fill in his assertion about the angles at a vertex
of a polygon in his proposed definition of _interior_ and _exterior angle_. This seems
a really challenging point to get settled to everyone's satisfaction.

Then we took time to work on 5.3 in pairs. Mr Wendt and Miss Goodmundson eventually
took turns presenting. Mr Wendt was using Mr Walters' definition of exterior angle,
and Miss Goodmundson used Hitchman's.

> **Theorem:** (Goodmundson) Let P be a polygon with $n$ sides which can be divided up
> into $T$ triangles by using diagonals. Then the exterior angles of P taken together
> make \( 2 * (n-T) \) right angles.

> **Conjecture S:** In the situation of Goodmundson's theorem: \( T = n-2 \).

If proved, Conjecture S would have the following Corollary: The sum of the exterior
angles of a polygon taken together makes four right angles.

Miss Dvorak started us on a discussion of Conjecture S. Her hope was to construct a
proof by induction. We pretty quickly saw that things would be difficult for general
polygons, so we added _simple_ to the hypothesis. But it was hard to see exactly how
we could use our definition of the word convex to get through here.

> **Conjecture T:** Let P be a simple \(n\)-gon. Then it is possible to divide
> P into \( n-2 \) non-overlapping triangles by inserting diagonals of P.

We would like to have an algorithm for inserting the diagonals that always works,
and a proof that it does always work and result in exactly the required number of
triangles.
