title: Big Progress

You made lots of progress today! For not many headline theorems, a lot of interesting
things happened.

First, we had discussions about how the three attempts from last meeting sorted out.
Miss Van Nevele went first, and later with a little help from Miss Rehnstrom, we got
these:

> **Theorem:** (Van Nevele, et al.) Suppose we consider Mr Maggert's pentagon,
> where AB intersects CD at G and AE intersects CD at F. Then
> the angles AFG, AGF, BGC, and EFD, taken together, are congruent to the angles
> ADC, AEB, ABE, ECD, DAE, and CAB taken together.

> **Corollary:** Angles ABC, BCD, CDE, DEA, EAD, AFG, AGF, BGC, and EFD, taken
> together, are congruent to the angles ACB, CBE, BED, EDA, and DAC taken together.

This has the effect of connecting the angles of the "three triangles" formed naturally
by the self-intersection of the polygon to the angles of the "rounded out" polygon
formed by tossing in extra segments.

Mr Stuhr and Miss Jacobs also presented on attempts to handle these crazy pentagons.
All throughout, everyone seemed to come to the conclusion that the sum of the exterior
angles of Maggert's pentagon should be greater than four right angles.

Also, Mr Baker introduced a fish-shaped pentagon to consider.

Miss Jacobs presented on Question M, with a proposal for definitions of the words
convex and not convex.

> **Definition:** (Jacobs) A polygon is not convex when one or more of its diagonals
> lies outside the figure.

> **Definition:** A polygon is convex when for each of its diagonals, that diagonal
> lies inside the figure.

This should influence the resolution of Question J. Also, we noted that this uses the
word "inside," which hasn't been defined, yet. Fortunately, the milk!

Mr Maggert presented on Question N. He had two proposals, one of which we decided needed
consideration. Miss Rehnstrom chimed in with another variant.

> **Definition:** (Maggert) Let P be a polygon and let X be a point. We say that X lies
> outside of P if there is a sequence of segments and a ray which start at X and do
> not intersect any of the sides of P.

> **Definition:** Let P be a polygon and let X be a point. We say that X lies
> outside of P if every ray from X which does not meet a vertex of P meets P an
> even number of times.

Of course, negating these leads to definitions of a point lying inside a polygon.

We had just really got started on these. So, we need to think them over. Do you like
either one?

> **Question O:** Are the two definitions of a point lying outside a polygon equivalent?

We'll have to sort this out to make more progress.
