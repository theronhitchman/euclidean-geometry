title: Midterm &amp; stuck
---

I spent the first 15 mintues of class discussing finer points from the Midterm
Formative Assessment.

  - the nature of a proof by contradiction
  - the nature of a proof of an equivalence (an "if and only if")
  - Some fun with diagrams of quadrilaterals
  - being careful with the task on diagonals of parallelograms
    (prove they meet at all, then prove they bisect each other.)

Mr Kessel took up 8.1, but it got muddled and he passed the chalk.

Miss Cohen took up 8.3, trying to write a proof by contradiction, but again, it
didn't quite come off.

Miss Mitchell made the claim that 7.3 is true if we add the hypothesis that both of
the triangles ABC and DEF are acute (in that each of the three angles is acute in
both triangles). The main sticking point is this very believable claim:

        If ABC is an acute triangle, then the foot of the altitude from B
        lies between A and C.

We agreed that given the claim, the rest of her argument will work.
