Mr Fisher completed his work on 7.5. We talked a bit about how this biconditional
statement gets proved by using one direction to help in a proof by contradiction
of the other direction. That is one of my favorite styles of proof. It makes me happy.

Miss Hatchett and Miss Teske took shots at 8.1. Then Miss Stuffelbeam took a crack
at it.

> **Theorem:** (Stuffelbeam) 8.1 is a theorem.

(I am getting tired of typing today.)

Then Miss Benson completed 8.2, which she correctly remarked had a lot in common with 8.1.

Mr Opheim then took a stab at 8.4, but concluded he needed more time to finish his work.
