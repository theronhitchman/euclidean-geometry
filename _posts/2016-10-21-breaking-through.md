title: Breaking Through, and a Tough Question
---

Mr Phaly started our meeting with an attempt at 7.5. It didn't work out the way he wanted,
so that one remains open.

The Mr Phaly shared with us a proposed definition for Question J, which I will
restate below:

    Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. We say that the angle ABC is an interior angle
    of ABCD when the angle bisector of ABC meets the quadrilateral in a point different
    from B.

Then Miss Schultz proved 8.1.

Then Miss Van Ryswyk took up Conjecture 8.2. Her work is largely similar to that
in Miss Schultz's presentation, but there were two interesting points:

  * First, one needs to show that even a pair of angle bisectors meet. When challenged
  on this, Miss Van Ryswyk quickly found that she could use Postulate 5 to do the
  job (much like Miss Shere's argument for Theorem 1.2).
  * Second, Miss Shere wonders if there is trouble over not knowing the relative
  positions of the points I and C. Of course, we all believe that I should lie
  inside the triangle ABC, but what if we don't know that?

I think what needs to be done is this: Miss Van Ryswyk (and the rest of us) should
evaluate the extent to which her argument actually uses the figure. If the figure
is just a convenience, then the argument is fine and we are done. But we should be
careful that there is not some hidden way in which the nature of the drawing is
making part of the argument for us. If things are bad in this way, we can rethink
our approach.

Finally, Miss Schwan presented on A.7. She also wanted to present on something
out of section B of the trig supplement, but we ran out of time.
