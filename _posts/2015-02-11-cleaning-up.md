title: Cleaning Up

Miss Brandenburg finished her argument from last time, and then made a conjecture she named after her cat.

> **Theorem:** (Brandenburg) Consider the construction of a rhombus. If we
> choose C so that angle ABC is not a right angle, then there are three other
> points C', C'', C''' which lead to congruent rhombi.

> **Conjecture K:** (Rosie Brandenburg) These are the only ways to get
>congruent rhombi out of the construction.


This closes up Conjecture G. Miss Bulic then presented on 3.7.

> **Theorem:** (Bulic) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. The midpoints of the four
> sides are the vertices of a parallelogram.

Mr Maggert took on Question F. It seems that he is very nearly all the way to
proving that our construction of a rhombus will allow us to also specify
either angle A or B in advance, too. We shall see how the final product
looks.

Mr Baker then took on Problem 4.3, noting that Euclid's proof of Proposition
I.4 uses steps which have **no axiomatic support**, namely superposition of
the two figures. Since we do not have superposition as a postulate, this is
bad argument.

Open Questions: F, I, J, K, 4.1, 4.2. I am not ready to give you more stuff, yet. I want to finish a bit more of this, first.
