title: Catching Up
---

We are slowing catching up to the end of our crazy list of presentations. Today's
happenings:

- Miss Goedken completed her proof of the Midline theorem.
- Miss Bavido gave this definition to complete challenge L:

  > Definition: [Bavido] Let \\(\ell\\) be a line and let A and B be points not
  lying on that line. We say that A and B lie on opposite sides of \\(\ell\\)
  when the \\(\ell\\) meets the segment AB. We say that A and B lie on the
  same side of \\(\ell\\) when \\(\ell\\) does not meet the segment AB.

- Miss Herran attempted conjecture 3.7, but we got muddled in some angles in a
special case.

- Miss Mitchell presented joint work with Miss Maus on 3.7, proving the conjecture.

At the end of the hour, we had the following queue: Van Ryswyk on I, Shere on 3.4,
Cohen on H, Ahrens on 4.1.

The current up-to-date list of unsolved problems is: 2.2, 3.4, D, H, I, J, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3.
