We had two presentations and two mini-lectures today.

Mr Reihman gave an argument for his Conjecture D. We talked about how this is
an "if and only if" statement, so it needs two proofs.

Then I spent some time discussing the axiomatic method.

Ms Carpenter shared work related to the second statement of Conjecture 1.1. In
the end her result is:

*Theorem: (Carpenter)* Let ABCD be a square. Assume that the diagonals AC and BD
meet at a point X. Then angle BAC is congruent to angle BDC.

And I gave a pep talk about how

        "Half a proof is no proof, but Progress is Progress."
