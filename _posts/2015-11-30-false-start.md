Well, not much got done over break, it seems. I hope Wednesday goes better.

Mr Ratz presented Euclid's beautiful proof of the Pythagorean Theorem (Task 13.1).
Everyone  learns about this theorem in high school, and the luster seems to have come off
of it. But note that Euclid chose it as the big finale for Book I. It pretty clearly
is _the reason Book I was written_. Think about it some more. It is an amazing
result, and it deserves a little wonder.

Ms Wulfekuhle presented on 12.2, and met the challenge of making the construction
work in 7 steps.

I hope to see more about the theory of equal content soon.
