title: Euclid Troubles
---

Today I distributed the first issue of the class Journal. It has seven papers by
six authors. It is now posted on the journal web site.

We began with a pair of presentations on item 4.1. Miss Ahrens and Miss Maus
identified troubles with Prof. Ball's argument:

  - it appears that the case "E lies inside the triangle" never happens
  - in other cases, it appears that Prof Ball has reasoned from poorly drawn
  figures: the points F and G seem to _split_ so that one of them lies
  inside of a segment, and the other lies outside of the relevant segment.

I then set some challenges that focus on the particular issues:

  > **Challenge O:**
    1. Figure out where the point E in Prof Ball's argument actually ends up?
    Can we describe this point in some interesting way? Maybe we can prove that
    it never lands inside the triangle.
    2. Construct an explicit example of a triangle ABC where the points F and G
    fail to have the situation that Prof Ball claims.

Mr Phaly then took up Challenge 4.3, reporting that Euclid's proof of Proposition
I.4 is founded on a use of "applying one triangle to another." This relies on an
idea of motion which is not contained in the system of postulates, so is invalid.

I talked for a bit about Hilbert's modernization of the planar geometry axiom system,
and how it uses the statement of Proposition I.4 as a _postulate_ not a theorem.

Then Miss Van Ryswyk shared her work on Conjecture I, showing off a better set of
cases, including one that requires a much more careful argument and more cleverness.
