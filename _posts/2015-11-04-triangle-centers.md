title: Triangle Centers!
---

Today we finished section 8 of our task sequence, and so we discovered the
_circumcenter_, _circumcircle_, _incenter_, and _incircle_ of a triangle.
These are two of the four classical triangle centers. If we go fast, we might see
the other two: the _orthocenter_ and the _centroid_.

Mr Cowden solved 8.3.

Mr Matthes solved 8.4.

Mrs Day proved this result we found useful:

> Theorem: (Day) Let ABC be a triangle, and let \\(r_A\\) and \\(r_B\\) be the
> angle bisectors of the angles at A and B, respectively. Then \\(r_A\\) and
> \\(r_B\\) are not parallel.

Then Mr Ratz finished 8.2.

I have just posted sections 9 and 10 of the problem sequence. This is all about
the beauty of properties of circles. Go read Propositions 1-34 of Book III.
