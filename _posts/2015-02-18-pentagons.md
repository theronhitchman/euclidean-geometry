title: Pentagons of Peril

---

Miss Rehnstrom worked out the rest of 4.1 to share with us today.

Then we had a discussion about pentagons. In the end, there seems to be no reason _in the definition of the word polygon_ to reject Mr Maggert's example.

You all seem pretty annoyed about that. So, we have two options:

* learn to live with a wider concept of polygon and see what you get.
* make a new, "better" definition of polygon and use that instead.

It was suggested that one clue we might use to help us decide would be the
applicability of Miss Hegewald's argument for Question 5.2. I like that a
lot. Let's see how her argument works for each of our examples, and let's see
what we can do with hexagons, etc. Then maybe we can make up our mind.
