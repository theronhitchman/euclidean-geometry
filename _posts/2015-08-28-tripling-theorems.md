title: Tripling the Theorem Count
---

We started our day by talking about how the technical process for writing will
work in this class. We also took a quick look at GeoGebra, which you will find
useful.

I was really excited that we found some new theorems today! We now have three,
which is three times as many as we had before! Mr Ratz started our presentations.

**Theorem (Ratz, 1.6)**, Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then ABCD is a parallelogram.

Mr Cowden then took over with a construction of a rhombus. We discussed the
proper format for this kind of work, including how to count steps, and the fact
that one needs both the construction recipe and the proof that it works.

**Theorem (Cowden, 1.4)**, Let AB be a given segment. Then it is possible to
construct a rhombus having AB as a side using a compass and straightedge.

Miss Kirkpatrick noted that Mr Cowden's construction is quite flexible. I noted
that mathematicians answer questions by proving theorems, so perhaps we should
find a conjecture to prove. We ended up with this one.

**Conjecture D (Cowden-Kirkpatrick, 1.5)**: Let XYZ be a given angle and AB a given
segment. Then it is possible to construct a rhombus BACD such that angle BAC is
congruent to angle XYZ using Mr Cowden's method.

For Monday, prove more theorems. Let me know if you want to talk.
