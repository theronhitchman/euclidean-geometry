title: Day 26&colon; Hitchman's trimphant return
---

Mr Hawkins began the meeting by discussing a proof by induction that his algorithm
works.

Hitchman then did a mini-lecture, with an example, about how to write a proof by
induction. As an example, he proved:

> **Theorem:** For each natural number \\(n\\),
> \\[ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} \\]

Miss Herbst took up 6.3, and proved this theorem:

> **Theorem:** Let ABCD be a rhombus. If angle A is congruent to angle C and both
> are right angles, then ABCD is regular. If angle A is congruent to angle C but
> they are not right angles, then ABCD is not regular.

Miss Bachmeier was in the middle of a presentation about 6.4 when we ended class.

After class, I took stock of what we have accomplished. This appears to be the
current list of open problems:

* Task Sequence 4: 4.1, 4.2
* Task Sequence 5: 5.1
* Task Sequence 6: 6.4, 6.6, 6.7
* Class Conjectures: G, K, P, Q, R, T

I also posted Task Sequence Part 7 to the web.
