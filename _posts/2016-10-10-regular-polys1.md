title: Regular polygons

Well, we tore right through section six of the task sequence.

Mr Merck proved Conjecture 6.1.

Miss Schmeling proved Conjecture 6.2.

Miss Schultz proved Conjecture A.2 from the supplement on trigonometry.

Miss Van Ryswyk disproved Conjecture 6.3. I challenged her to make a specific
construction, which she did: use a rhombus with an obtuse angle.

Miss Maus attempted 6.4, but got stuck on questioning.

Miss Ahrens proved Conjecture 6.5.

Miss Cohen proved Conjecture N: showing that the notions of Cohen convexity and
Conger convexity for kites are the same.

And then I posed this question: Are these then equivalent to our definition(s) of
convexity for general polygons?

Then Mr Conger proved Conjecture 6.4 is false, and upon challenge constructed a
detailed counterexample. (It looked like a house!)

_Updated: the initial version of this omitted Miss Schultz's work. I am sorry for the
error. It is an unfortunate fact that I sometimes forget to write down work by
people who are not cool enough._
