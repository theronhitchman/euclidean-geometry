Mr Maggert presented on task 8.3. This didn't quite come to a conclusion.

Miss Manternach presented on Conjecture R.

Mr Schulte presented on 10.1. He succeeded "through the power of proof." :)

Miss Jacobs presented on Conjecture Q. She started a proof by contradiction, which
felt like a good idea, but this is not, yet, complete.

Mr Baker presented on 10.5. But the class was not convinced and we decided to return to
it later.
