title: Cleaning Up

We started with a short presentation by Ms Van Ryswyk:

    Theorem:(Van Ryswyk) If the angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent, then
    the point of intersection will inside the triangle.

Then Ms Schwan presented B.7.

Ms Herran presented a new approach to 7.4, which had some trouble near a use of
parallel lines that weren't actually parallel.

Ms Ancona presented on 8.4. Her approach broke things up into many cases, and the
one we spent the most time on was for right triangles. This tried to use the
midline theorem as a tool, but the class was not convinced.
