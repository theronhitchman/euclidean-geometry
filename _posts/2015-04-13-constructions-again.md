title: More Constructions
---

Miss Jacobs shared work that helps us finish a proof of Mr Maggert's construction
for 11.3.

> **Theorem:** (Jacobs) Let ABCD be a non-convex kite. Extend the diagonals to lines.
> Then the extended diagonals meet at a right angle.

Mr Henry presented on 11.8. His original construction had 8 steps. During discussion
it came out that the proof uses the _converse_ to III.18. Henry and Maggert discussed
and found a shorter construction (six steps), but in the end, the proof still needs
the converse to III.18. Can we find that or prove it?

Mr Maggert shared a five step construction for 11.7. By experiment (GeoGebra) it
appears to work. But for now, we have only the sketch of a proof.

Then we took some time to work.
