title: Merck's Notes on Day 17
---

_Note: Thank you, Mr Merck, for taking notes on the meeting._

Class began with a presentation by Ms Cohen on joint work with Ms Schultz. They
point out the trouble that Euclid only handles one of the relevant cases. There
was discussion involving Miss Shere and Mr Conger, but it appears that things
were resolved.

The class made a question related to our understanding of kites.

> **Question U:** (Cohen-Goedken) In a non-convex kite, can the intersection
point of DB and AC be collinear with CAE?

Mr Phaly took up Challenge R. This looks like it generated LOTS of conversation.
Mr Phaly's proposed definition:

> Possible Definition: If there exists a point A such that a ray from point x
through A intersects with the polygon P, then it is inside the polygon. It is
outside the polygon if there is a point X where a ray from A does not intersect
the polygon P. Point A cannot lie upon the lines of the polygon P.

Miss Goedken presented an example which does not meet our expectations with this
definition.

> **Question V:** (class) What classes of polygons break Mr Phaly's proposed
definition.

> **Question W:** (class) When two or more line segments of a polygon cross,
does the intersection create another vertex?

> **Question X:** (class) In a non-convex kite, if diagonal AC is extended to a
line, will that line AC always cross segment BD?
