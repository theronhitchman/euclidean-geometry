Mr Stuhr completed conjecture 9.1.

Mr Maggert started a proof by contradiction for 8.3, but things got muddy.

Then we broke into teams. Those on the window side of the classroom worked on Conjecture R.
Those on the door side of the room worked on completing Mr Maggert's argument.

Open Problems List:

The current list of open problems is this: 5.2 and 5.3
(non-convex cases, and how do our current arguments use convexity?),
6.7, 8.3, 9.4
L, N, O, P, Q, R.

I have posted set \#10.
