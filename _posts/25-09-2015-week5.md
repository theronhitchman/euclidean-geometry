title: Week Three Wrap up

---

What happened in week three? I don't really know. But the reports I got from
Mrs Day and Mr Ratz tell me this:

### Wednesday 9 September

(As reported by Mrs Day, mostly with pictures of the board.)

Ms Davis spent a marathon session on a neat approach to finishing Conjecture 1.2. It seems the class was not convinced, ultimately. But I think the approach
was pretty clever. I think that _finishing_ that argument will require us to look at what the phrase "point E lies inside the rhombus ABCD" might actually mean, since Euclid doesn't define it.

Miss Kirkpatrick proved Conjecture G.

And there was a picture of Conjecture H, but the message I got did not attribute it to anyone.

### Friday 11 September

(As reported by Mr Ratz.)
