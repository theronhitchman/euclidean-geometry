title: Week Three Wrap up

---

What happened in week three? I don't really know. But the reports I got from
Mrs Day and Mr Ratz tell me this:

### Wednesday 9 September

(As reported by Mrs Day, mostly with pictures of the board.)

Ms Davis spent a marathon session on a neat approach to finishing Conjecture 1.2. It seems the class was not convinced, ultimately. But I think the approach
was pretty clever. I think that _finishing_ that argument will require us to look at what the phrase "point E lies inside the rhombus ABCD" might actually mean, since Euclid doesn't define it.

Miss Kirkpatrick proved Conjecture G.

And there was a picture of Conjecture H, but the message I got did not attribute it to anyone.

### Friday 11 September

(As reported by Mr Ratz.)

Mr Ratz began with an attack on Conjecture 2.1 and Conjecture F at the same time. It seems there was some discussion and an adjustment, but ultimately these two items are considered closed.

Mr Rundall attempted Conjecture 2.4, but this was not accepted by the class as complete.

Miss Wulfekuhle settled Conjecture 2.3 by giving a construction of a kite and a proof that her object was indeed a kite.
