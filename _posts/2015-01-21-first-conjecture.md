title: Our First Conjecture
---

We had a very full second meeting. I was so happy to see it! Here is a quick summary
of events.

Miss Manternach presented on the second half of Conjecture 1.1. From this we have

> **Theorem:** (Hegewald-Maternach-Stuhr) If ABCD is a square, then angle BAC is
> congruent to angle BDC.

> **Conjecture A:** If ABCD is a rhombus and is not a square, then angle BDC is not
> congruent to angle BAC.

Mr Baker gave a presentation on 1.4. From this we learned:

> **Theorem:** (Baker) Given a segment AB, it is possible to construct with straightedge
> and compass a rhombus having AB as a diagonal.

It was pointed out that Challenge 1.4 asks for a rhombus with a given _side_, so
the original question is not closed, yet. Still, progress is progress, and we are
glad to have the theorem.

Miss Rehnstrom proved Conjecture 1.6, and we discussed how the similarities in
the proof to the arguments for 1.1 make this kind of thing a _corollary_.

> **Theorem:** (Rehnstrom) If ABCD is a rhombus, then ABCD is a parallelogram.

Then Miss King gave a short presentation on 1.7. This didn't quite turn out, and then
class ended!

Next time, I expect we will see more work from Mr Baker and Miss King, and also Miss Hegewald,
who waited patiently but didn't get a chance to share.
