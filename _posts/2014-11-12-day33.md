Today's successes include:

> **Theorem:** (Opheim, with Bieber, Nieman, Walters) The perpendicular bisectors of a
> triangle are concurrent.

> **Theorem:** (Walters) Let A be a point lying outside a circle, and suppose that
> tangents are drawn to the circle from A which make contact at the points B and C.
> Then AB is congruent to AC.

> **Theorem:** (Teske) A rectangle is always a cyclic quadrilateral.

The current list of open tasks, according to my records is this:

  * 4.1, 4.2
  * 6.7
  * 9.4 (second half), 9.5
  * K, R, U

I have also posted task sequence parts 10 (challenging tasks about circles), and
11 (the beginnings of our construction challenge game).
