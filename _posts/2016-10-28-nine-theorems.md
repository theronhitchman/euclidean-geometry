---


This was an amazing day where we had nine presentations, all successful.

Ms Shere presented A.4 and A.6.

Ms Mitchell presented A.8 and A.9.

Ms Mitchell presented near 7.3, and shared these:

    Lemma: (Mitchell) If ABC is an acute triangle, then the foot of the altitude
    from A lies between B and C.

    Theorem: (Mitchell) If ABC and DEF are acute triangle with corresponding
    angle, side, and side congruent in that sequence, then ABC and DEF are congruent.

Mr Conger presented 9.1.

Mr Merck presented 9.1 by a different argument.

Mr Merck presented 9.2.

Mr Kessel presented 9.3.
