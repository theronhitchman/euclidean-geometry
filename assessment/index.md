The structure and aims of Math 3600:01 are so radically different from a
traditional “computation based” mathematics course that I find the general
structure of assigning grades from an accumulation of points on homework,
quizzes, and exams to be completely unworkable. If I could get away with it,
I would not assign grades at all, and focus all of my energy on helping you develop.
However, the registrar demands that I assign grades.

I can usually sort out a reasonable “grade” for each student by the end of the
semester by some sort of mysterious process of watching and listening in class.
There are several difficulties with this, which are probably apparent to you:

1. It requires that you trust me and my professionalism.
2. It mixes up formative assessment and summative assessment pretty badly.
3. It has no formal feedback mechanism.
4. Students do not necessarily identify the same things as important that I do.

I can not see any way around problem (1). Even the traditional "points
accumulation" process requires this. I choose not to deal with item (2). In
fact, I am deliberately leaving it mixed up so that I can help you all as much
as possible. But items (3) and (4) are about clear communication of expectations
and of perceived progress. That I can do something about. I choose to use a
communication scheme inspired by things called "Standards Based
Assessment," and "Specifications Grading."

So, I will set out some description of those things I deem as
important for the students in this class to improve upon. This makes clear the
kinds of things I really hope you are working on this term. These are somewhat
nebulous, as we are working on the kinds of qualities and habits you need to be
a competent mathematical professional. We will refer to the items in this list
as the standards.

Also, I will describe a scheme for documentation and communication of your
demonstrated proficiency on the standards, and a little bit about how I will try
to use this information to assign a grade at the end of the term.

Of course, this scheme is as likely to have failures as another, but I hope that
it won’t distort incentives and cloud communication in the way that traditional
grades do. It is my belief that if you tried to “game the system” to improve
your grade, you would be doing exactly the kinds of things I wanted you to do,
and improving your abilities as a mathematician. That is, after all, my only goal.

At any point in the semester, if you would like more detailed discussion of my
view of your mathematical skills and how you can work to improve them (i.e. your
grade), please come talk with me.
