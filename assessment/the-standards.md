Every one of these points is the conclusion to a sentence which begins:
    Students will demonstrate that they can...

#### Mathematical Investigative Process:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- explore examples
- make appropriate choice & use of technology in investigation
- look for and use structure in an uncertain environment
- persevere by trying multiple approaches

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- extend ideas to find or create new mathematics
- devise a relevant new conjecture
- modify hypotheses or conclusions to make work more tractable

#### The Axiomatic Method:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- use definitions to justify assertions (in both directions)
- use literature (Euclid or class work) appropriately to justify assertions
- prove or disprove statements by making correct logical arguments (direct, indirect, by cases)

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- make a clear definition to fit a new concept
- prove a difficult theorem requiring an intricate argument or a deep, original idea

#### Planar Geometry Content:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- write arguments involving the properties of
    * congruence for polygons
    * parallel lines
    * compass and straightedge constructions
    * circles
    * Euclidâ€™s conception of area

#### Oral Communication:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- present ideas clearly with precision about mathematics
- handle questions respectfully and directly
- ask questions respectfully and directly

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- Make effective use of presentation technology (chalk, computer, other)
- engage in meaningful critique

#### Written Communication:

*Foundational Proficiencies:*

- write in clear English prose
- use proper mathematical style
- use language with precision and care
- effectively construct and use figures
- produce professional quality documents
- read new mathematics for understanding

*Advanced Proficiencies:*

- write concisely, balancing clarity and brevity
- critique written mathematics critically in a peer review setting

***

Students who wish to pass the course should demonstrate mastery of the
foundational proficiencies. To earn a higher grade, a student must demonstrate
mastery of some portion of the advanced proficiencies.
