title: Standards for Assessment

### Explanation:###
The structure and aims of Math 3600:01 are so radically different from a
traditional “computation based” mathematics course that I find the general
structure of assigning grades from an accumulation of points on homework,
quizzes, and exams to be completely unworkable. If I could get away with it,
I would not assign grades at all; however, the registrar demands that I do it!

I can usually sort out a reasonable “grade” for each student by the end of the
semester by some sort of mysterious process of watching and listening in class.
There are several difficulties with this, which are probably apparent to you:

1. It requires that you trust me and my professionalism.
2. It mixes up formative assessment and summative assessment pretty badly.
3. It has no formal feedback mechanism.
4. Students do not necessarily identify the same things as important that I do.

I can not see any way around problem (1). Even the traditional “points
accumulation” process requires this. I choose not to deal with item (2). In
fact, I am deliberately leaving it mixed up so that I can help you all as much
as possible. But items (3) and (4) are about clear communication of expectations
and of perceived progress. That I can do something about. I choose this semester
to use a communication scheme called “Standards Based Assessment.”

So, in what follows I will set out some description of those things I deem as
important for the students in this class to improve upon. This makes clear the
kinds of things I really hope you are working on this term. These are somewhat
nebulous, as we are working on the kinds of qualities and habits you need to be
a competent mathematical professional. We will refer to the items in this list
as the standards.

Also, I will describe a scheme for documentation and communication of your
demonstrated proficiency on the standards, and a little bit about how I will try
to use this information to assign a grade at the end of the term.

Of course, this scheme is as likely to have failures as another, but I hope that
it won’t distort incentives and cloud communication in the way that traditional
grades do. It is my belief that if you tried to “game the system” to improve
your grade, you would be doing exactly the kinds of things I wanted you to do,
and improving your abilities as a mathematician. That is, after all, my only goal.

At any point in the semester, if you would like more detailed discussion of my
view of your mathematical skills and how you can work to improve them (i.e. your
grade), please come talk with me.

<center><h2>The Standards</h2></center>

Every one of these points is the conclusion to a sentence which begins:
    Students will demonstrate that they can...

#### Mathematical Investigative Process:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- explore examples
- make appropriate choice & use of technology in investigation
- look for and use structure in an uncertain environment
- persevere by trying multiple approaches

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- extend ideas to find or create new mathematics
- devise a relevant new conjecture
- modify hypotheses or conclusions to make work more tractable

#### The Axiomatic Method:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- use definitions to justify assertions (in both directions)
- use literature (Euclid or class work) appropriately to justify assertions
- prove or disprove statements by making correct logical arguments (direct, indirect, by cases)

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- make a clear definition to fit a new concept
- prove a difficult theorem requiring an intricate argument or a deep, original idea

#### Planar Geometry Content:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- write arguments involving the properties of
- congruence for polygons
- parallel lines
- compass and straightedge constructions
- circles
- Euclid’s conception of area

#### Oral Communication:

*Foundational Proficiencies*

- present ideas clearly with precision about mathematics
- handle questions respectfully and directly
- ask questions respectfully and directly

*Advanced Proficiencies*

- Make effective use of presentation technology (chalk, computer, other)
- engage in meaningful critique

#### Written Communication:

*Foundational Proficiencies:*

- write in clear English prose
- use proper mathematical style
- use language with precision and care
- effectively construct and use figures
- produce professional quality documents
- read new mathematics for understanding

*Advanced Proficiencies:*

- write concisely, balancing clarity and brevity
- critique written mathematics critically in a peer review setting

The general scheme for communication about student progress toward standards
will be as follows:

    Every three weeks you will have a short individual conference with me to
    discuss your progress so far, and perhaps make a plan for what to work on
    next. I welcome student-initiated conversations at other times.

Students who wish to pass the course should demonstrate mastery of the
foundational proficiencies. To earn a higher grade, a student must demonstrate
mastery of some portion of the advanced proficiencies.
