title: Assessment&colon; What's Typical

I have taught this course a great many times. The clearest thing I can say about
assigning grades is this: I know approximately what the work looks like at each
grade.

### What does an A look like?

A student who earns an A has typically published about ten papers, at least one
of which contains something really amazing: something showing a beautiful insight,
real perseverance, or extreme cleverness.
(By the way, extreme cleverness usually lies underneath a huge pile of work.)
This student has also been the referee for several papers by peers.

Such a student usually has shown some intellectual leadership, and has demonstrated
some of the "advanced" levels of proficiency in more than one standard.
This student's final exam paper has solid work on all of the tasks assigned.

### What does a B look like?

A student who earns a B has typically published five or more papers, and has
demonstrated competence in all of the "foundational" standards, and at least one
of the "advanced" standards. This student has also refereed a few papers by
peers. This student's final exam paper has solid work on most of the tasks assigned.

### What does a C look like?

A student who earns a C typically has published more than one paper, and has demonstrated
proficiency with all of the "foundational" standards, though those performances
may be uneven enough that at the close of the semester I am not certain all those
standards have been mastered. This student may or may not have been a referee.
This student's final exam paper successfully navigates only one or two of the tasks
assigned, and shows a lack of understanding on the others.

### What does a D look like?

A student who earns a D has typically published only one paper, usually very late
in the term. I lack confidence in the fact that such a student has a good grasp of
the "foundational" standards. This student's final exam paper perhaps has one task
successfully completed, but the others show a serious lack of depth.

### What does an F look like?

A student who earns an F has usually taken an extremely passive approach to the course.
This student may have a publication of dubious quality, or none at all. This student's
attendance is spotty, and participation on days present is almost non-existant. This student's
final exam paper demonstrates an inability to complete the most straightforward tasks.
