Assessment comes in a variety of forms, but there are only two for us to be
concerned with: _formative_ assessment where I help you evaluate your learning and
pick a path to improve, and _summative_ assessment where I decide at the end of the
course to what extent you have demonstrated mastery of the course goals and use
that information to assign grades.

From your point of view, formative assessment will play into the kind of feedback
you receive from me and your classmates. (From mine, formative assessment is how
I gather such information and use it to guide the development of class. This will
likely be invisible to you.)

## Formative Assessment: Feedback on Your Work

I will be keeping track of what goes on during class to the best of my ability.
After each presentation, the class will have a conversation about your work:
this is your primary source of feedback. Sometimes, I may send an email
with some extra comments about your progress. I think of this mostly as a
_formative_ assessment. It is a way for me to gauge your progress and help you
focus on improving your work.

Through the journal process, you will receive referee reports on your submitted
papers. These are the equivalent type of feedback on your written work.


## How Summative Assessment Works

I will use the following things to assess your work this term:

- Published papers derived from your work and class presentations.
- Reports you write while serving the class journal as a referee.
- Reflective self-assessments you write at conference times.

At the end of the semester, you will collect all of these things into a portfolio.
I will use the contents of your portfolio to set your semester grade.

Each individual item you produce contributes to my understanding of your learning.
I will make available detailed and clear <strong>specifications</strong> for what
constitutes acceptable work. Most of our class time will be spent doing and discussing
mathematics, so the way to meet the specifications will become apparent as we go.

### The Portfolio Assignment

The specifications for the portfolio assignment are discussed
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/assessment/portfolio.html).

### Published Papers

The normal mode of work for this class leads to publication of your work in the
class journal. Specifications for this work are as follows:

- The mathematics presented must be complete, correct, and clearly presented.
- The article should follow conventions for mathematical writing as detailed in
the [Style Guide for the journal]({{site.baseurl}}/writing/style-guide.html).

### Referee Work

As part of the journal process, you will serve as a referee for the work of other
students. The specifications for referee reports are listed in the
[Instructions for Referees document]({{site.baseurl}}/writing/instructions-for-referees.html).

### Reflections & Conferences

To facilitate the communication process, we will schedule regular conferences
to discuss your progress. You will meet with me for a ten or twenty minute appointment
at three points during the term. The first meeting is the longest, and that is
too much work for me to really get done in a single week, so I will divide the
class into two parts. The first group will meet with me during weeks 3, the second
group will meet with me during week 4. I will meet with the whole class during each of
weeks 7 and 12.

To give these meetings some substance, I require that you write a one page
reflection and either bring it to our meeting or email it to me beforehand. The
point of these reflections is for you to engage in an honest self-assessment. This
is an important part of learning and growing!

- [Reflection Prompt #1][prompt1] (weeks 3 and 4)
- [Reflection Prompt #2][prompt2] (week 7)
- [Reflection Prompt #3][prompt3] (week 12)

Of course, you are welcome to come by and talk about mathematics, or your
progress in the course, at any time I am available.
