\section{Instructor's Preface}

This opening section is aimed at an instructor who wishes to use these notes for the first time.
I have deliberately aimed the discussion at someone who is \emph{new} to using inquiry-based methods in class. I have written a lot of this introduction as a description of what I do with these notes, knowing full well that they work for me in this way, but you, dear reader, are a different person.
More experienced instructors will know what to ignore and adapt things to their own style without much effort.
I hope newcomers to inquiry-based learning will appreciate specific instructions about how I run a class from these notes, and take them as a set of suggestions rather than as prescriptions.

Below the reader will find discussion of all of the major components of the course, and how I run the critically important first day.
Then I give some contextual notes for each item in the script, section-by-section. These are much heavier at the beginning of the sequence, where things are probably less certain for a new instructor and more guidance would be helpful, and lighter at the end, where I hope the user will have picked up the feel of things.

Please note that the introduction to the student version of the notes is completely different, as is the commentary text between tasks. The student version is written in my voice as advice to the students, and another instructor might want to adjust bits that feel alien.

\subsection{The Nature of this Course, and How it Came to Be}

This is a task sequence for a one semester course in Euclidean  geometry, designed and implemented over a decade at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), and used more than a dozen times. UNI is a medium-sized, comprehensive, public university, with a history as a normal school and a mission focused on training pre-service teachers. 
I have used these notes with classes ranging in size from six students to twenty-five students. As seems to be the case with many (modified) Moore Method courses, things seem to run best with about eighteen students.

The majority of students who enroll in this course are in a Mathematics (Secondary Teaching) major program. Usually, they are sophomores or juniors, and are still novices at finding and writing their own proofs. UNI has recently instituted a ``bridge course'' focused on proof writing, but this is not a pre-requisite for Euclidean Geometry, so previous experience is mixed. There are often transfer students who take both courses in their first semester at UNI. Most students recall that they once took a course labelled ``geometry'' in high school, but do not have much (any?) content knowledge remaining. Only occasionally do I see a student who has internalized the exploratory spirit of mathematical work before enrolling in the course.

Though the students do not really know even the most basic geometry, I do not wish to insult them by telling them so. Nor do I wish to get bogged down in building planar geometry from a modern conception of a good axiomatic system like Hilbert's\cite{Hilbert}. I do want to give them a sense of history, and to get to at least a few really beautiful theorems. To meet all of these goals at once, I use Euclid's \emph{The Elements}\cite{Euclid} as a text book. I have the students read the first four books, which gets through material on congruence of triangles and polygons, constructions (especially of regular figures), properties of circles, and area. We must stop short of discussing similarity of figures.

The main goal of the course is to get the students working the same way that mathematicians do. This includes the process of finding, presenting, and writing rigorous arguments, but goes further. It is important to me that the students also work at other mathematical sense-making tasks: making definitions of unclear concepts, exploring examples, formulating conjectures and questions in precise mathematical language, and critiquing the work of others both for correctness and for clarity. 

The choice of Euclid as a text serves these goals, too. \emph{The Elements} has many statements which are hard to understand, many arguments which are incomplete or poorly supported by the axiomatic structure assumed, and many truly terrible definitions. This set of notes is designed to get students to critically evaluate the mathematics at every level, including Euclid's work. This is most obvious in section four where it is done explicitly. But careful reading of the notes will show many other ways in which things are not quite clearly done. (Most of these are intentional and noted in the commentary below. I am sure others remain.) One particularly nasty spot is the definition of the word \emph{polygon} at the beginning of section five. 

Rather than worry over this set of deficiencies in \emph{The Elements} and in these notes, I take the view that each such difficulty is a teaching opportunity. Students will notice gaps in arguments, trouble with definitions, possible theorems that they need but are not stated as official problems, and confusing statements. Each instance creates a need for a fix. I simply ask the students to take up the responsibility of sorting out how they think things should be, and make that part of their work. Since the students find the trouble spots, they feel like they own the mathematics when they go about setting things right.

This makes up an important part of the course that I think of as ``the hidden task sequence.'' Each time a trouble comes up, I challenge the students to come up with a conjecture or question and formulate it as carefully as they can. We then add that to the list of tasks to work on. A typical semester has between fifteen and twenty-five class-made questions and conjectures. I keep these in a separate list (posted on the class web site), labeled with capital roman letters. Only once I have I had to go beyond Z to AA and BB. I have included one semester's list of class-made tasks in the appendices.

Another benefit of incorporating the use of student-made conjectures is that it normalizes the ordinary and common failures to mathematical work. If a student errs by making an extra hypothesis, just rephrase the theorem, and add a task to the sequence of the form ``Question X: Is Conjecture x.y still true in general?'' or something similar that seems appropriate. This happens often in the beginning of my courses, and students soon learn that ``partial progress is progress'' and that both asking good questions, and making interesting mistakes are valued.

These tasks are also structured to provide some intellectual scaffolding for the process of asking questions and making conjectures. It is my experience that asking students to explore and make a conjecture is not fruitful. But asking students to explore and make a conjecture in a well-situated context with some guidance as to what a reasonable conjecture might sound like can be rewarding. One can see this happening in section two of these notes, where the process is modeled explicitly, using the results from section one.

The guiding principle of the course is to mentor the students through the process of working like mathematicians do when making sense of things. I think of the students as a little community of new mathematicians, isolated from the rest of the world but with an accepted set of reference literature (\emph{The Elements}) as their foundation. As instructor, I play the role of senior scholar, trying to get the most out of each student however I can. I explain this metaphor to my students, and note that each of the pieces of a mathematician's professional work has a part in our analogy. Presenting in class is like speaking at a conference. Writing for the class journal (see below) is just like getting published.

This set of tasks owes a great deal to the work of others. These are the debts that I can recall, though there are probably many others collected over the last decade.
My introduction to inquiry-based learning, and specifically the Moore Method, was in a workshop run by G. Edgar Parker. That workshop was originally designed by Stan Yoshinobu, who I met later. I am heavily indebted to Timothy McNichol for his paper \emph{The Extreme Moore Method}\cite{mcnichol}, which I read right after that workshop. Later, I read the book \emph{The Moore Method}\cite{cmmp}, and I attended a workshop run by Carol Schumacher and Michael Starbird. Through the Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning I got mentoring from T. Kyle Petersen and Gary Richter. I also learned some things about how to construct a set of tasks by reading the text
\emph{Number Theory Through Inquiry}\cite{nothy} by David Marshall, E.~W.~Odell and Michael Starbird.
All of these people have influenced my teaching and the construction of this task sequence. I also recognize a debt owed to The Educational Advancement Foundation, which supported travel and participation in those workshops and several conferences.

Finally, this set of notes started by appropriating the exercises at the end of chapter one in Robin Hartshorne's lovely book \emph{Geometry: Euclid and Beyond}\cite{hartshorne}. A reader familiar with that book can probably see it hiding in the bones of this task sequence, though the book simultaneously does rather more (in terms of material) and rather less (in terms of training students to do open-ended inquiry).


\subsection{The First Class Meeting}

The importance of a good first meeting cannot be understated.
Students have to reach an understanding of how class will run and what is expected of them.
Also, at least one student has to have very visible success in front of the class.
It should also be possible to coax out a first student-made conjecture.
Here is how I run the first day:\\[.1in]

\begin{compactdesc}
\item[\textbf{Phase I}] I arrive early and put the first three definitions and Conjecture 1.1 on the board.
I reassure students that they don't need to copy this down, as I will hand it out to them later.
I also try to put them at ease with plenty of small talk about how I need to work out between semesters so that I can write so much.
This usually spills into the first minute or two of class.
When I am certain that the class is all present, I introduce myself briefly and ask them to try to prove the statement on the board with a partner. 
I tell them that they should just use whatever they think they recall from high school geometry.
This first task has been designed with several purposes in mind. There is a discussion about the different pieces of this task and their purposes following its statement below.\\[.1in]

\item[\textbf{Phase II}] Now I give the students time to work in pairs.
As they work, I walk about and introduce myself to them and learn their names one pair at a time.
Along the way I have to take a couple of questions about mathematics, but mostly I am trying (1) to put faces to names on the roster and (2) to make myself more approachable.\\[.1in]

\item[\textbf{Phase III}] After about twenty five minutes, someone has an argument for at least part of Conjecture 1.1.
I call for volunteers, but if none materialize I call on a pair that I saw do something worthy.
I invite one student to come to the board to share ideas.
After the student gets up, but before they start speaking, I interrupt and explain the basic ground rules to the class.\\[.1in]

We use only last names.
We are polite to a fault.
When in our seats, we ask questions rather than give arguments.
The presenter's job is to convince the class, but everyone else is trying to stay unconvinced as long as is reasonable.
We take ten to fifteen minutes to give the presentation and discuss it.\\[.1in]

Sometimes, the first presenter has a gap in their argument. 
In this case, it is important to do two things: (1) very clearly locate the error, and (2) find something of mathematical value in the presentation for which I can praise the student.
It is best if the class locates the error.
I try to do no more than ask if we are all in agreement.
Finding the praiseworthy aspect of a poor presentation is sometimes challenging, but you \emph{must} authentically praise an effort at the beginning of the course for something.\footnote{I learned this from Ed Parker.}
Then I bring up a second person.
When we have a completed argument, we thank the speakers with applause. I mention that the presenter is now responsible for writing for the class journal, and that they should see the course web site for some information.
Often it is the case that some students have noticed that the second claim in Conjecture 1.1 is false. If there is time, I will try to pull out of them a firm statement and argument for that claim. But sometimes this just needs to be pushed off to the beginning of the second meeting.
\\[.1in]

\item[\textbf{Phase IV}] After the speaker, I explain that this is how we shall spend all of our class time.
I hand out the student's preface and the first section of problems (on the rhombus).
I explain that they should try to find proofs for the rest of Conjecture 1.1 and for the next few items before the next class.
We discuss that the point of the class is to gain power as a mathematician, and that means learning to find and defend our own arguments, so the only allowed resources are \emph{The Elements}, the course task sequence, and the class journal.
I mention that collaboration is fine, but credit must be given.
At this point, we are usually just over time, so I let the class go with wishes for good luck.\\[.1in]
\end{compactdesc}

\subsection{Subsequent Meetings}

Save for the day of the midterm and the final meeting, every other day of the course follows the same plan. I arrive as early as I can and chat with students as they show up. I take the first three to five minutes of class to do two things: 
\begin{compactenum}
\item  I briefly recap where we are in our study. For example, I might say, ``Today we continue our work on rectangles and properties of parallel lines. Last time we struggled a bit with how to use Euclid's fifth postulate, but at least saw that it was good for guaranteeing the existence of a new point.''
\item I ask for volunteers to present and sort out who will 
go to the board and in what order. A typical day will have between four and six presentations. Things go a little faster during the constructions.
\end{compactenum}

The process of turning a list of volunteers into an ordered list of presenters is both simple and delicate. It is very easy to ask for volunteers and patiently wait until the students have helped make a list of presentations for the day. As they volunteer I make a list on the chalkboard of presenters' names and task numbers. Of course, sometimes I must truly wait. The tricky business is that this is the time when I exert some control over what is going to happen in class. I get to choose who presents and in what order. Sometimes it is necessary to spur a presenter to volunteer. Sometimes I have to ask a reticent student if they have something to share even when I suspect they might not, just to remind them that this is important and I am keeping track.

I am open with my students that I want to have control at this point, but they should always volunteer if they have something to share. Once I have the information about who is ready, I can make decisions about who I want to present based on whatever my teaching goals are for the moment.

I should note that I encourage students to present different arguments for a single result, so if two or more students volunteer for the same item, I note all of them on my list. I choose someone to go first, and if that succeeds, I ask the others if their arguments are substantially different or not. If so, I have those students present, too.

When the list of presentations is set, I take a seat in the back of the class where I can see everyone, open my notes, and invite the first student to the board. We do the exercise where the student presents, the audience listens and questions, and I direct traffic. On some occasions, I have something to add, but I feel the best outcome is when the students sort things out. My job is typically to make sure the people who need to participate in a given conversation do so. When a presentation is resolved, I make a point to thank the presenter. I always thank the presenter by name. If I can, I offer praise for something specific and genuine, and if I must, I offer encouragement and empathy.

We repeat this as many times as we can.

It is important to view this basic template for class meetings as just that, a template. Think of it as a basic form of interaction that gives everyone in the room a structure to work in. But if it ever feels constraining, or somehow insufficient for the learning to be done, I get to my feet and make up something else. The truly important thing is that the students are working through their own understanding of mathematics. I do what I think works in the moment.

Finally, I want class to end with a short recap of significant new happenings. I will not pretend that this goes smoothly, because many days end with a presenter in a hurry to finish a thought. But I take pains to say something about the progress made, and perhaps preview a new idea or set of tasks on the horizon.



\subsection{Assessment}

The most important assessment mechanism in my course is the collection of daily presentations. Through them, I do a weird jumbled and intertwined mix of formative and summative assessment. In the moment, I prefer to work with it as formative assessment. But by the time the term is over, I have watched the students work with mathematics for months, and I have formed an idea about their capabilities. I find it is not difficult to render a professional judgement about those capabilities and decide upon a course grade. But that does not involve a great deal of paper, and it feels rather uncertain to some students. 

So I have devised another system on top of merely watching and interacting that provides for more formal communication with students about their progress. 

First, I share with the students a list of \emph{Standards for Assessment}. These are a public declaration of the kinds of things I will be looking at during the course. I have included a copy of this as an appendix.

Second, I give \emph{one midterm examination} and \emph{a final exam}.
The midterm examination is in-class, and must be very focused.
I tend to pick four questions that get at important mathematical skills I might not have seen everyone perform, yet.
I usually only include one new argument, and it should be an adaptation of an argument that the students have seen more than once.
There simply is not time in a fifty minute exam to ask for several proofs of new statements.
An example midterm is at the end of this guide.

The final examination is a week-long take-home.
I again ask four or five questions, each of which is new to the students.
There is usually one straightforward construction task.
I include this to be sure everyone has some measure of success on the exam.
I also include a conjecture that is a bi-conditional statement, one direction being false.
This is the challenging part of the exam: to notice the error, prove it is an error, and then repair the statement with the addition of a hypothesis.
If I have a question if a student deserves an A, quality work on this problem can change my mind.
An example exam is at the end of this guide.

Third, I schedule \emph{Assessment Interviews} with my students at three different times during the semester. I like to have these during weeks three, seven, and eleven. Each meeting is a twenty minute appointment where I can talk with a student one-on-one about their course progress. To give the conversations some focus, I ask the students to do a one page \emph{reflective writing assignment} before the meeting.
In the first meeting I mostly try to take away student anxiety about the nature of the course by being personable and getting to know them a little. I also give advice about work habits and encourage them to come back to talk about mathematics or their progress whenever they wish. In the second meeting students start asking about their progress more directly, and I often give advice about what skills to work on next. In the third meeting students usually take the opportunity to ask about grades specifically. In this way, I can address their concerns and share frank assessments in a private discussion.

In the end, a student who earns an A usually solves eight to ten tasks, including some difficult ones. A student who earns a C usually solves three tasks, all of low difficulty. I tell the students that a task only counts as complete if the paper has been published in the class journal.

\subsection{Class Materials}

I ask the students to obtain the following materials for this course:
\begin{compactitem}
\item A copy of Euclid's \emph{The Elements}. I prefer the edition by the Green Lion Press\cite{Euclid} because the text is well-made, with figures reprinted on new pages when arguments continue. This edition uses the standard translation by Sir Thomas Heath, but does not include the commentary common to other editions. The commentary would dispel too many mysteries for this course.

This text and the task sequence are the complete set of allowed references for the course. 

\item A research notebook. Any style will do, as long as it is dedicated to this course.
\item A compass and straightedge for drawing. Strictly speaking these are not required, but students will want them.
\end{compactitem}

Though it is not a required purchase, I also advise students of the existence of the dynamic geometry software package \emph{GeoGebra}.\cite{GGB}


\subsection{Course Web Site \& The Class Blog}

I maintain a simple web site for each iteration of my course. Firstly, this serves as a repository for course documents. This includes a link for the syllabus and links for other course documents about grading and the class journal, and I use this as the method to distribute new sections of the task sequence. The task sequence is divided into sections of related tasks, which I release a section at a time.

Also, I keep a class blog (on the same web page) about developments. Each day after class I take ten minutes to write a short post about what happened. I include statements of theorems proved and note who has credit for them. I also write up any new conjectures or questions that came up during that meeting.

The blog serves as a useful record of events for students who have to miss a day, and as a way for students and instructor alike to keep track of what tasks are currently open.

My particular web page is open on the internet, though it is secured by its obscurity. Only current students have any interest in its contents. At the conclusion of each semester, I archive all of the old blog posts and class journal issues and reset the page to avoid spoiling things for the next class.


\subsection{The Class Journal}

As part of the basic structure of the course, I run a class journal.\footnote{I have written about this elsewhere. It is to appear as \cite{MAANOTES}.}
A student who completes a task to the satisfaction of the class then is charged with writing up the result for publication. 

I provide the students with a \LaTeX\ template and guidelines for preparing their papers. They submit papers to me (as the managing editor) through a dedicated email address. Each paper goes through a review and revision cycle as many times as required to get it into a reasonable shape. At first, I play the role of referee and write up little referee reports for each paper. I play referee for each student's first two papers. Later in the term, I ask the students who have two or more published papers to help out and play referee. Again, I provide the students with guidelines for being a referee. If things are going well, I often turn over the refereeing completely by week ten or eleven. 

The whole process has to be explained to the class two or three times for everyone to get the big picture. I find it helps to explain that this is how professionals do it, too, and why it is important.

Every few weeks, I bundle together those papers which are finished and make an issue of the class journal to publish. One copy goes on the course web site as an electronic document. I make paper copies for those authors with a paper appearing and distribute them at the start of the next meeting.


\subsection{Other Advice, in No Particular Order}

I always stick to using last names in class. Students are ``Mr. Smith'' and ``Ms. Gonzalez.'' I ask the students to do this, too. This formality helps reinforce the basic dignity of each student and sets a floor for the level of respect we show to each other.

Of course, my students are mostly ``Iowa Nice,'' and my biggest challenge is not polite behavior. Rather, I have to encourage my students to ask tough questions and to admit confusion publicly.

I hand out the tasks one section at a time. The tasks in section one get distributed at the end of the first day. Section two usually goes out during the second week. I usually distribute a new section when there are only two remaining open tasks at the end of a meeting, though later in the term that number will be larger. The idea is to give the students enough to work on to stay busy, but to have the class mostly working on one small set of related problems, so they are all thinking about the same ideas.

My class does not usually finish all of these tasks. Most semesters the students are working hard on sections 14 or 15 as class ends, with about ten unfinished items from earlier in the term hanging around.

No result from this course is as important as the process of getting all the students engaged in the process of mathematical work. I gladly sacrifice the end of the task sequence to engage the students in ``making mathematics.'' Running my class meetings are a bit like playing jazz: we have a basic structure, but it is there just to give us a place to explore ideas and seek beautiful moments.\footnote{I thank Stan Yoshinobu for sharing this metaphor in a different, but related, context.} The students ideas are more important than the tasks I have designed.

I find the best learning results from respecting the students and their ideas. When I follow their lead and help them develop their own arguments, students can be spectacularly creative. It is common for me to be surprised by a new (to me)  and correct argument for a challenging theorem. I want to be mentor, cheerleader, and coach, and I must sometimes play counselor. I want to avoid being ``the smart guy in the room.''

This course is demanding. It is important to remember that students just get tired and bogged down at certain times of the semester. When this happens, I make up some way for us to be productive even if there are no presentations to be made. I ask a lot of my students, and they let me do it as long as I show empathy.

It is not unusual to have an extra five minutes. I use these as opportunities to give a mini-lecture on something related to the course. I find I use these topics frequently.
\begin{compactitem}
\item The axiomatic method, and how it distinguishes mathematics from science.
\item Euclid's postulates and their structure.
\item The history of the fifth postulate.
\item Some hyperbolic geometry basics.
\item The nature of a mathematical definition, and how such is different from a regular definition in a natural language.
\item What else is hiding in \emph{The Elements}.
\item A question that I am working on right now.
\item Some different ideas about what counts as geometry (differential geometry, metric geometry, algebraic geometry, etc).
\end{compactitem}

I do not, as a rule, tell the students when they have made an error. I do model asking questions sometimes. I often call on a student in the audience and ask them to ask a question, or to restate an argument in their own words. I spend a lot of time play-acting like I am confused until the students are clear about details. I do this to normalize the the idea that one can be good at mathematics and confused at the same time, and to reinforce that it is up to the students to get things right. If an error happens and the class accepts it, I wait to see if it gets resolved during the publication process, or I find a way to add a task to the sequence that should make the error apparent. 

\subsection{The Final Meeting}

The last day of class runs slightly differently than the rest. It often starts the usual way, with gathering of volunteers and a few last presentations. But I reserve the last twenty minutes for a conclusion.

First, I discuss with them what should come next. I talk to them about the other geometry courses offered which they might include their program. I also share with them the titles of some wonderful books they might read about geometry when the semester is over. For effect, I load a dozen or so of these previously-forbidden fruits into a big shopping bag and bring them out one-by-one as I talk about them, laying them on the table in front of me.

Next, I distribute the final exam. I read the instructions and give them five minutes to read through the tasks to be sure everything is clear. 

Finally, I thank them for a good semester, ask them to preserve the experience for future classes, and wish them luck.

\section{The Rhombus}

\begin{definition}
\label{defn:collinear}
We say that some set of points is \emph{collinear} when there exists a line passing through all of the given points.
\end{definition}

It is not always the case that my students have had instruction in basic set theory, so I try to stay away from the use of the word ``set'' as a formal thing. My students read the word ``set'' here as the common English word.


\begin{definition}\label{defn:quadrilateral}
A \emph{quadrilateral} is a figure consisting of four points, no three of which are collinear, in a given order and the four line segments joining points next to each other in the list.
Usually, we specify only the four points, so quadrilateral $ABCD$ consists of the points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$, called \emph{vertices} of the quadrilateral and the line segments $AB$, $BC$, $CD$ and $DA$, called the \emph{sides}.
\end{definition}

This definition is much closer to a clear and unambiguous technical definition. But it still has intended flaws. 
First, note that things are really stated twice, once without notation and then again with notation. 
In the version with notation, the importance of ordering the points is mentioned, but in the version with notation it is not. 
This will come up as a point of confusion at some time. 
In my experience, students will not notice the difference between the set of four points $\{A, B, C, D\}$ and the ordered sequence of four points $ABCD$ initially, but will later. 
When it happens, I use that as an opportunity for the students to clarify what they want and then state their own improved version with notation. 
This gives them some ownership of the mathematics.

Second, this definition allows for non-convex and even non-simple quadrilaterals. This is intentional. Having a more open definition simplifies some things and complicates others, and foreshadows the conversations about getting definitions sorted out that happens when we discuss the term ``polygon.''


\begin{definition}\label{defn:rhombus}
A \emph{rhombus} is a quadrilateral having all four sides mutually congruent.
\end{definition}

These first three are required to get through the first day of class! 


\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rhombus-angles}
Let $ABCD$ be a rhombus. Then angle $ABC$ is congruent to angle $ADC$. Similarly, angle $BAC$ is congruent to angle $BDC$.
\end{conjecture}

This conjecture is the object of the first day.
Note that the conjecture has two conclusions.
The first is true, but the second is false.
This is for two reasons:
(1) the figure relevant to the false statement encourages students to draw in the diagonal needed to find a simple proof of the first statement; and
(2) the point should be made early that not all conjectures in this course will be true.
Skepticism is important.

It is important that this theorem gets some sort of argument so that the process of presentation and discussion can be modeled before the students leave the first meeting.

Since this item is attempted during class on the first day, the resulting proof often lacks rigor in some key way. The most common way is that students do not quote triangle congruence theorems from Euclid properly, since they have not, yet, started to read it. This is easy enough for students to correct when they try to write the argument down with a copy of \emph{The Elements} at hand. 

Another common way is that students will draw both diagonals of the rhombus and give a proof that assumes these two diagonals meet. Of course, they do, but this will be unjustified, or justified by pointing to the diagram. 
This is a subtle error. If my students are making it and no 
one notices, I encourage them to introduce names for things and write up parts of their argument using those names.
That often helps students to see that a new point has been used without its existence being asserted. If students do not notice after that, I will take the otherwise unusual step of pointing it out. In any case, I help the students repair their work by adding a hypothesis to their theorem. It is important that the first class meeting has a theorem.\\

\begin{definition}\label{defn:diagonals}
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral. The \emph{diagonals} of $ABCD$ are the segments $AC$ and $BD$.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rhombus-diagonals}
The diagonals of a rhombus must cross.
\end{conjecture}

This item is very challenging.
Be careful not to let a weak student spin on it alone for too long, as it can become a trap that destroys their confidence.
Such a student should be encourage to work on other problems in parallel.

There are two natural arguments students make for this conjecture.
The first involves picking out a midpoint from one diagonal and proving that it lies on the other diagonal with the help of I.14.
This requires some creativity, and it doesn't always happen.

The second is a proof by contradiction that quickly splits up into many cases.
The second proof seems to be more common for my students, but they need help getting things organized.
This second proof also requires students to wrangle with the ideas behind ``the same side'' and ``opposite sides'' of a line.
If this is the route your class elects, don't be surprised if this problem is not solved until midterm time.
Setting up these missing terms from Euclid and proving a few very basic properties takes time and effort. But this kind of work, sorting out technical definitions for visually intuitive terms, is a big part of the work in these notes. This is just one of the concepts that Euclid does not give a satisfactory treatment, and the discomfort students feel about this is a good motivator for the importance of a clear and usable mathematical definition.


\begin{challenge}
\label{conj:rhombus-angles-redo}
If your argument for Conjecture \ref{conj:rhombus-angles} did not use Conjecture \ref{conj:rhombus-diagonals}, find a new argument that does.
Conversely, if your argument did use Conjecture \ref{conj:rhombus-diagonals}, find an argument that does not.
\end{challenge}

This is not strictly necessary, of course. 
Many semesters my students just ignore this item, but
it is included to make the point that many facts have more than one proof.
This encourages students to look for different avenues, or possibly to present a second proof of a result that a classmate has hit first.
I also use this as an opportunity to discuss the process of making extra hypotheses when stuck.

Note that the introductory paragraph in the student notes is phrased the way it is because I hand out the whole first section of tasks at the end of the first meeting, during which the students find a partial resolution to Conjecture \ref{conj:rhombus-angles}. If you use these notes differently, you will want to adjust this.


\begin{challenge}
\label{prob:rhombus-construct}
Given a segment $AB$, find a compass and straightedge construction of a rhombus $ABCD$.
Enumerate your steps and give a proof that the construction works.\footnote{A \emph{step} only counts if you draw something, like a segment or an arc of a circle.}
\end{challenge}

This is a straightforward construction task. When some variant of this has been presented successfully, I take control of class for a bit to lead several related conversations: 
(1) I discuss the change in tone from ancient Greek mathematics (if you can't construct it, it doesn't exist) to the modern constructive existence proof.
(2) I re-iterate what it means to enumerate steps (only things drawn with a compass or straightedge count), and how the presentation should have both a recipe for construction and a proof that this construction works.
(3) I lead a conjecture-making brainstorming session focused on the next task. 
This can all be accomplished in ten to fifteen minutes if done efficiently, but it is okay to allow more time for the important task of conjecture-making.

\begin{question}
\label{prob:rhombus-flexible}
How flexible or rigid is the construction solving the last problem?
Can one use the construction to create many non-congruent rhombi, or are there only a few options?
\end{question}

It is often the case that the first solution a class finds for Challenge \ref{prob:rhombus-construct} is just a special case.
This encourages a discussion which can lead to the general construction of the whole family of rhombi having a given side.
If students are encouraged, they will often ask good mathematical questions about the results here, and generate lots of official questions and conjectures for the class list. I have included this item in the official task list (rather than just waiting to bring it up in class) to make the point to students that they should start considering this kind of question. Having it here on the list also makes the class conversation after Challenge \ref{prob:rhombus-construct} more fruitful. I do not allow presentations for this item until the meeting after Challenge \ref{prob:rhombus-construct} has been presented successfully.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rhombus-is-parallelogram}
If $ABCD$ is a rhombus, then $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.
\end{conjecture}

Students very often come to class believing this is a property of rhombi, and they want to use it on the first day.
They get disappointed when it is pointed out this property is not part of the definition, so it is unavailable.
This conjecture lets them shore up their belief in the statement.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rhombus-diagonals-angle}
Let $ABCD$ be a rhombus. Suppose that the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ meet at a point $X$.
The angle $AXB$ is a right angle.
\end{conjecture}

This result often gets proved very quickly, as it is a simple triangle congruence argument. I always stop things for a short discussion about how making an extra hypothesis can keep us from being stuck: we get to claim progress and we focus attention on what remains to be considered. I encourage them to work this way.

\section{The Geometry of Kites}

This section of the tasks is designed to get students thinking about pushing their techniques, but being watchful for what is really true. Each of the statements here is an attempted generalization of a statement the students will have already considered for rhombi. 

\begin{definition}\label{defn:quad-sides-type}
Two sides of a quadrilateral are called \emph{adjacent} when they share a vertex and \emph{opposite} if they do not.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{defn:kite}
A \emph{kite} is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent and congruent sides.
\end{definition}

Note that this definition would actually allow a figure with a set of three congruent sides. (My thanks to the referee who pointed it out.) No student in my course has, yet, noticed this. If it were to happen, I would make it another example of letting the students alter the official definition to suit their needs, sorting out the possible resolutions through experiment and conversation until we reach consensus as a class.

It is my experience that students will not initially consider a non-convex kite. My classes will show up the first meeting after these tasks have been distributed claiming to have finished all of them, but they will have errors from not having a broad enough imagination. I suppose the word ``kite'' 
evokes the idea of the traditional toy so strongly that they cannot see past it.
These tasks are partly designed to encourage the students to see that convexity is an issue.
Their arguments will often work just fine if the kites under consideration are ``like this,'' and not ``like that.'' In this way, we build the need for a new word and a clear definition of what counts as ``this'' and ``that.''
I avoid mentioning the word convex until after the students have expressed a need for the concept. In this setting, my students usually come up with a other language for particular examples (like a ``dart'' or a ``Star Trek kite''). We then set some class conjectures around sorting out the resulting mess.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:kite-opp-angles}
Pairs of opposite angles in a kite are congruent.
\end{conjecture}

This is false. Rather, it is only partially true. A simple argument with congruent triangles will establish that one pair of opposite sides in a kite is always congruent. The other pair need not be. 

Students often have trouble stating their result precisely, and this should lead to a conversation about setting up notation and using it as a vehicle for clarity. After some attempts to state which pair of angles are congruent using natural language descriptions, students can appreciate the power and utility of naming the vertices of the kite and stating things in those terms. If notation doesn't magically appear, I usually ask the students to do a two minute writing exercise for a "good version" of the statement. Then I pair them up to critique for two minutes, and then we have a class discussion starting from their work. ("Please share an example where your partner's work is good.") If we move briskly, this is a well-spent ten minutes.

The other conversation that comes up here is about how to prove something is false. Given the work on Conjecture 1.1, this is a chance to remind them about how counterexamples work: give an explicit construction of the example and prove it has the properties required. I do not always have this conversation in this exact spot, just to keep things moving.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:kite-diagonals-cross}
The diagonals of a kite must cross.
\end{conjecture}

Again, this is false, but it requires the students to imagine a non-convex figure. The conversation about counterexamples should come up here if it has not already.

\begin{problem}
\label{prob:construct-kites}
Give a construction (with proof) of a kite.
How general is your construction?
\end{problem}

There is lots of room to work in this task. A student may or may not give the most general construction possible. I use this as an opportunity to have students ask questions and make conjectures about how flexible or free this construction is. It is not hard to get three or four interesting questions out of this. I add these to the task sequence immediately. Given the time to think about it in a brainstorming session, it is possible to get a conjecture along the lines of ``Given two segments and an angle, it is possible to construct a kite having the given segments as sides and the given angle between those sides." I have had classes state it as "Given a rhombus ABCD, it is possible to make choices in Ms. Y's construction to construct a rhombus congruent to ABCD."

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:kite-is-parallelogram}
If $ABCD$ is a kite, then it is a parallelogram.
\end{conjecture}

Again, this is false. Sometimes, students will approach this one in a non-constructive way, proving a statement like ``If ABCD is a kite and a parallelogram, then it is rhombus,'' taking it as a given that there exists a kite which is not a rhombus. Depending on the resolution of the 
previous items, they may already know that.


\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:kite-diagonals-perpendicular}
If the diagonals of a kite meet, then they meet at a right angle.
\end{conjecture}

This leads to some good productive confusion. Expect students to have a disagreement about what is meant by the word ``diagonal.'' Some will think of it as a segment, and others will think of it as a line. I let the students have a conversation to sort it out. If they choose to change the definition to something different from that written in the tasks, I ask that they go back through their work and see what damage they may have wrought on previous work.

Many students will be confused by the need for the hypothesis, since it relates to convexity. In some classes, it is not until this point that students recognize that they need to consider such figures, and they have to go back and revise all of the work they have done on the other tasks in this section. 
There is a potential danger here: it would be a bad situation to have a week's worth of work somehow ``invalidated.'' Student morale would certainly suffer. But, as mentioned above, my students typically bring all of these tasks to one meeting and we find out things are not quite right before that day is out.

\section{The Geometry of Rectangles}

The most challenging aspect of this section for students is that they remember facts about rectangles, but often they are not sure which parts are part of the definition and which parts are theorems. We open with the definition as a reminder.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:rectangle}
A \emph{rectangle} is a quadrilateral which has all four interior angles that are right angles.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rectangle-parallelogram}
Let $R$ be a rectangle. Then $R$ is a parallelogram.
\end{conjecture}

This item and the next are straightforward items, but they are the first times that students will be required to use results about parallel lines and right angles. A discussion of the parallel postulate might come up.

In any case, it is important to get the students to focus on using the definition as written, not as they vaguely recall.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rectangle-opp-sides}
Let $R$ be a rectangle. Then each pair of opposite sides of $R$ is a pair of congruent segments.
\end{conjecture}

This item can be derived as a simple consequence of the last and Euclid I.34. Students often just give their own proof independent of I.34.

I have had classes prove that this item is a consequence of the last item, and then also prove that the last item is a consequence of this one. It is then important to have a conversation about equivalent statements, and how we don't really know either of them, yet.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:rectangle-diagonals}
The two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.
\end{conjecture}

Beware! Students often just assume that the diagonals of a rectangle meet. If it seems to be sliding by the class, I will ask, "How do you know that point exists?" That will catch the presenter by surprise, so I often help them to modify their result by adding a hypothesis, and then we add an item to the student generated task sequence. Be sure to point out the similarity to Conjecture 1.2, though students will usually already see that.


\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:opp-congruent-implies-rectangle}
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral such that angles $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$ are right angles.
If segments $AB$ and $CD$ are congruent, then $ABCD$ is a rectangle.
\end{conjecture}

This is incorrect, but in a sneaky way. As my definition of polygon allows for non-simple figures, it is possible to construct a counter example. Simply reflect half of a rectangle in one of its diagonals. Alternately, construct a non-isosceles right triangle and then reflect the legs in the perpendicular bisector of the hypotenuse.

Students often ``prove'' this result as written and get it past the class. When this happens, I try to find a way to make them realize it (without telling them) by asking pointed questions about how the assumptions in this item and the next one are different. 
It is also possible to address this when Thales' theorem in section 7 is proved.


\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:opp-parallel-implies-rectangle}
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral such that angles $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$ are right angles.
If segments $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, then $ABCD$ is a rectangle.
\end{conjecture}

This can trip students up as they try to give a proof by contradiction and use the parallel postulate at the same time. It helps to ask the students to work through the logic on this one extra slowly.

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:midline-theorem}
Let $ABC$ be a triangle, $D$ the midpoint of $AB$ and $E$ the midpoint of $AC$.
Then the line through $E$ and $D$, called a \emph{midline}, is parallel to the line through $B$ and $C$.
\end{conjecture}

This is challenging. Don't let a struggling student spin on it too long without help. This is sometimes called \emph{the midline theorem}. Students are sometimes tempted to use similar triangles to prove this result. This urge is natural, because generalizing the midline theorem to other values of the ratio $AD:AB$ is a way to build a theory of similar triangles.



\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:Varignon}
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral. The midpoints of the four sides are the vertices of a parallelogram.
\end{conjecture}

This pretty result is a simple corollary of the last item, if you draw diagonals of ABCD. Again, this can be an opportunity to show students that non-convex and non-simple figures exist. I usually ask students if they looked at this using GeoGebra, and then open up a GeoGebra sheet to show them how this looks when the input quadrilateral is dragged around. Students who have not considered it might ask "Does that count?" when they see those figures show up on the screen. This is an opportunity to start or continue the conversation.

\section{Developing an Attitude of Skepticism}

The items in this short section sometimes don't get addressed completely. I find it acceptable to let them sit for a long time, because their mere existence is enough to make the point 
that students should not trust Euclid any more than they trust a classmate.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:Ball}
Read Professor Ball's argument and figure out what went wrong.
Recall that you can find it on the course web site under the "Class Journal" tab.
Pinpoint his error and present it to the class.
\marginnote[-20pt]{Prof. Ball uses a result he calls the hypotenuse-leg theorem, which states that if two right triangles have two pairs of corresponding sides congruent, and one of the pairs is the hypotenuses, then the triangles are congruent. For now, we grant that this theorem is true, and is not the source of Prof. Ball's error. We'll come back to address this theorem later when we study triangles in detail.}
\end{problem}

I post a copy of this nicely disguised fallacy on the my course web site as an example paper before the term begins. When students ask how to write their papers, I point to this as a simple guide for basic style. It is always my hope that some student reads this provocative argument and immediately objects. But I find that I have to explicitly ask my students to take up the task. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob:fix-I.7}
Figure out what is wrong with Euclid's Proposition I.7 and fix it.
\end{problem}

The trouble with Euclid I.7 is that only one case of many is considered. One can sort out which cases are missing and give each of them a similar short argument to settle the matter. The concept Euclid glides over is again a kind of ``betweenness,'' where points lie on either the same side or opposite sides of a line, just like Conjecture \ref{conj:rhombus-diagonals}. If it has not, yet, come up, this is an opportunity to set the students a class-made challenge about making good definitions for those concepts. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob:fix-I.4}
Figure out what the problem is with Euclid's Proposition I.4.
\end{problem}

This is the infamous ``Pons Asinorum.'' The trouble here is the use of superposition, and the lack of axiomatic support for that. I always lead a short clarifying discussion here about how this early proposition violates the spirit of the axiomatic method, and how modern writers often include I.4 as a postulate rather than as a theorem. (This applies to Hilbert's system, for example.)

\begin{problem}[Standing Problem]
As the semester progresses, we will have occasion to read over a hundred different arguments by Euclid, if any of the others we read have gaps, please consider giving a short presentation about it.
(Hint: there are several of these to be found.)
\end{problem}


\clearpage
\setcounter{section}{5}
\setcounter{problem}{0}
\section{Polygons}
Now it is time to extend our venue to \emph{polygons} with an arbitrary number of sides.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:n-gon}
Let $n$ be a natural number. An \emph{$n$-gon} is a figure consisting of $n$ points $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, prescribed in order and called \emph{vertices}, and the $n$ line segments, called \emph{sides}, $A_1A_2, A_2A_3, \ldots, A_{n-1}A_n, A_nA_1$.\\
A \emph{polygon} is an $n$-gon where $n$ has not been specified.
\marginnote[-20pt]{Note: Commonly used terminology includes the following: 3-gon = triangle, 4-gon = quadrilateral, 5-gon = pentagon, 6-gon = hexagon.}
\end{definition}

This definition is very open, and intentionally so. In fact, it introduces a conflict with the notion of a quadrilateral from earlier in the notes, in that a $4$-gon can have three collinear vertices. And there is still the problem of non-convex and non-simple figures. My students quickly become dissatisfied with the state of affairs and we end up having class conversations about what they believe to be a polygon and what they do not. I choose students to lead these conversations, and intentionally stay out of the way. This can take several days. I am careful to direct traffic by having the students pass the chalk around as the conversation moves, and I will jump up at some point and ask the students to make as many crazy examples as they can think of to show why the stated definition is not a good one. From this conversation should come several class-made conjectures and questions, now that we are really at the heart of the matter. Students will arrive at concepts like the following quite naturally:\begin{itemize}
\item What do we mean by a ``convex'' polygon?
\item What do we mean by a ``simple'' polygon?
\item What does it mean for two points to ``lie on one side'' of a
given line?
\item What does it mean for two points to ``lie on opposite sides'' of a given line?
\item What is a serviceable definition of the word polygon?
\item What does it mean to say that a point lies ``inside'' a given polygon?
\item What does it mean to say that a point lies on the ``inside'' of a given angle?
\end{itemize}
Be warned that this conversation could take several meetings. I ask the students to continue working on open problems while we are doing this, and I often give them a small challenge to prep for the next meeting to be sure the conversation continues. For example, ``Look at examples and decide for yourself if it is important to require that vertices of a polygon should be non-collinear. Be prepared to argue for your position and take a class vote next time.''

I allow the students to rewrite any of the definitions as long as they agree to it as a class, and then they have to abide by the consequences. At some point in this long conversation it will come up that students think I am withholding the ``correct'' definition from them. I take that opportunity to tell them that mathematics is a cooperative enterprise and our definitions are those that working mathematicians generally agree are the best for doing their job, and that has to be sorted out through conversation. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob:exterior-angle}
Suppose that $A,B,C$ are three consecutive vertices of a polygon. 
If at the vertex $B$ we extend one of the two sides through $B$ to a ray, then we create a new angle, called an \emph{exterior angle} to the polygon at $B$.\\
This construction has a choice in it. 
In principle, this could be a problem. 
Describe the problem, then state and prove a theorem that resolves the issue.
\end{problem}

This is intended to be an easy exercise to keep struggling students in the game. You might introduce the term ``vertical angles'' if the students do not do so on their own. Note that with the very generous definition of polygon above, the exterior angle of a non-convex figure could well point towards the inside. My students 
find this unsatisfactory and it helps spur them into making their own definitions.


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:ext-angles-pentagon}
The exterior angles of a pentagon, one choice made at each vertex, add up to four right angles.
\end{conjecture}

This is true for convex pentagons, but false in general. Some semesters students will investigate enough with GeoGebra to 
prove interesting theorems about non-convex and non-simple figures. In any case, I always manage to get questions about those as class-made questions.

\begin{question}\label{question-induction}
What is the sum of the exterior angles of a hexagon? 
What about a general $n$-gon? 
Can you find a way to build on our understanding from small values of $n$, to general values of $n$?
\end{question}

This is the one opportunity to build up an inductive argument, if you are so inclined. Students will discover that a general polygon can be dissected into triangles, but probably will take that for granted. This is an opportunity to help students alter their hypothesis and make a meaty conjecture.

\section{Regular Figures, A Warm-up}

This section begins with some straightforward items. I reserve 
these for students who have not has as much success. I privately encourage students who are doing well in class to spend their energies on the rather more challenging class-made conjectures from the last section, and I privately encourage those who need a lift to spend a little more time on these tasks. 

\begin{definition}\label{defn:regular}
A polygon is said to be \emph{equilateral} if all of its sides are congruent, \emph{equiangular} if all of its angles are congruent, and \emph{regular} if it is both equilateral and equiangular.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:equilateral-triangle}
An equilateral triangle is equiangular, hence regular.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:regular-rhombus}
Let $ABCD$ be a rhombus. If angle $A$ is congruent to $B$, then $ABCD$ is regular.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{definition}[reminder]\label{defn:square}
A regular quadrilateral is called a \emph{square}.
\end{definition}


\begin{problem}\label{prob:equilateral-quad}
Does Conjecture \ref{conj:regular-rhombus} hold if we replace ``angle $B$'' by ``angle $C$''? State a result and prove it.
\end{problem}

The answer is ``No.'' This is an opportunity to reinforce how to write about counterexamples. 

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:equilateral-pentagon}
Let $ABCDE$ be an equilateral pentagon. If angle $A$ is congruent to angle $B$, then $ABCDE$ is regular.
\end{conjecture}

This is false. When the class has progressed through these four items, I stop to point out how this is an example of 
systematic investigation of simple examples, structured in a natural way. This could be continued of course, but already pentagons show things are a bit more difficult. It is an opportunity to ask students to make some more conjectures of the same type as the above results. Sometimes my students state and prove theorems about equilateral pentagons with three angles congruent. 

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:regular-pentagon-central-triangle}
Let $ABCDE$ be a regular pentagon. The triangle $ACD$ is isosceles.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:reg-pentagon-angles}
Let $ABCDE$ be a regular pentagon. State the relationship between the angles $CAD$ and $ACD$ that shows how special the triangle is. Prove your observation.
\end{problem}

This is the challenging task in this set. The hardest part for my students is avoiding the use of measuring angles in degrees and instead stating their result as one about ratios of angles in the triangle $ACD$. (Angle $ACD$ is twice angle $CAD$.) Often, we find middle ground by getting a statement where angles are described as having some ratio to a right angle. (Angle $ACD$ is four fifths of a right angle.)

\begin{problem}\label{prob:reg-pentagon-types}
Find experimental evidence for the number of regular pentagons with a given side. (Try using five toothpicks!)\\[.1in]
\end{problem}

The results of this will depend upon what the class accepts as the definition of the word polygon. If they require polygons to have no self-intersections, there should be only the one. If they allow non-simple polygons then there will also be the five-pointed star.

\section{Deeper Into Triangles}


\begin{problem}
\label{prob:triangle-inequality}
Show how to construct three segments which are not congruent to the sides of any triangle.
\end{problem}

Note that Euclid I.20 is a geometric statement of the triangle inequality. That makes this an easy task to complete. After this is successfully presented, I mention the triangle inequality and mention that it is a very important tool for modern mathematicians, especially in analysis. This is a conversation that can be expanded to touch upon more modern metric space geometry ideas if time permits, just to pique interest.

\begin{definition}
\label{defn:right-triangles}
A triangle is said to be \emph{right} if one of its angles is a right angle. 
The side opposite the right angle is called the \emph{hypotenuse}. 
The other sides are called \emph{legs}.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:RASS}
Let $ABC$ and $DEF$ be two right triangles, with the angles at $A$ and $D$ right angles. 
Suppose that $BC$ is congruent to $EF$ and $AB$ is congruent to $DE$. 
Then the triangles are congruent.
\marginnote{This is sometimes called the \emph{hypotenuse-leg} theorem.}
\end{conjecture}

Students are tempted to prove this using the Pythagorean Theorem (Euclid I.47). Note that this is not one of the propositions they have read so far. Instead, I require students to find another way. Ordinarily, students find an argument that relies on superimposing the two triangles. This relates to Problem \ref{prob:fix-I.4}. With some patient questioning, students can be coaxed to ``create a copy'' of one of the triangles in the place where they wanted to relocate it. This is a little tricky, and might take a few tries. 

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:ASS}
If we weaken the hypothesis of the previous conjecture so that the angles $A$ and $D$ are still congruent but no longer assumed to be right angles, and leave the other hypotheses intact, the conclusion still holds.
\end{conjecture}

This is false, but in an interesting way. Sometimes students will explore what they can say, and find there is only trouble when $A$ and $D$ are congruent obtuse angles, and even then there are only two possible triangles. This leads to a realization that the words acute and obtuse are really good for something geometric, and it allows for some open-ended inquiry for an enterprising student. At a time that feels appropriate, I will relate this to the difference between the Pythagorean Theorem and the Law of Cosines. One can say interesting things about how this relates to a quadratic equation having zero, one, or two solutions.


\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:thales1}
If $AB$ is the diameter of a circle and $C$ lies on the circle, then angle $\angle ACB$ is a right angle.
\end{conjecture}

This is pretty easy, but it uses the common technique of drawing some key thing not originally in the figure. At this point I pause to point out how useful that is as a general technique in classical geometry, and suggest that they might try it on any outstanding open problems where they feel stuck. If appropriate, I then add, ``Hint. Hint. Conjecture \ref{conj:rhombus-diagonals}.''

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:thales2}
If $\angle ACB$ is a right angle, then $C$ lies on the circle with diameter $AB$.
\end{conjecture}

This direction is the harder of the two. I like a proof by contradiction best, because it ends up using Conjecture \ref{conj:thales1}. Note that there are two cases, but if you can handle one, the other comes along in a similar way.

Note that, together, Conjectures \ref{conj:thales1} and \ref{conj:thales2} yield this result:
\begin{theorem}[Thales' Theorem] 
Let $A, B, C$ be three points. 
The angle $\angle ACB$ is a right angle if and only if $C$ lies on the circle with diameter $AB$.
\end{theorem}

I always stop the class and have a short conversation about 
the idea of an ``if and only if`` statement. It is important to dispel the mystery of which part is which. I also share 
that some prefer the terms ``necessary and sufficient`` and discuss what those mean in context.

\section{The Center of a Triangle}

At this point, the tasks pivot a little. Fewer tasks are used as set-up to get the students conjecturing and making definitions. Usually, there are many student-devised conjectures and questions still to answer, and it is easy enough to allow the students time and space to sort those out. There are still a couple of obviously and deliberately open-ended items, but now the students have taken ownership of the material and the process and it is more appropriate to just ask them questions and see what they do with them.


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:angle-bisectors-concurrent}
Let $ABC$ be a triangle, with rays $r$ and $s$ the angle bisectors at $A$ and $B$, respectively. Suppose that $r$ and $s$ meet at the point $I$ which lies inside the triangle. Draw lines $l$ and $m$ through $I$ that are perpendicular to $AC$ and $BC$ respectively. If $l$ meets $AC$ at point $X$ and $m$ meets $BC$ at $Y$, then triangle $IXC$ is congruent to triangle $IYC$.
\end{conjecture}



\begin{definition}\label{defn:concurrent}
Three segments (or lines or rays) are called \emph{concurrent} if they all pass through a common point.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:incenter-concurrent}
The three angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent.
\end{conjecture}

There are two subtle points here to discuss with the students. Following on from Conjecture \ref{conj:angle-bisectors-concurrent}, Conjecture \ref{conj:incenter-concurrent} feels like a quick corollary. But this relies on
the fact that two angle bisectors must actually meet so that we are in a situation to apply Conjecture \ref{conj:angle-bisectors-concurrent}. I prefer that the students notice it, of course, but I always make sure we discuss it and set an extra class-made task if the students have not included this step in their work. Also, the typical proof uses the idea that segment $IC$ has the property of an angle bisector at $C$, so it must be (part of) the angle bisector. That requires that the angle bisector of a given angle is \emph{unique}. Depending on time constraints, I might set this as a task for the students to prove, or I might just discuss it with them and sketch a proof briefly.

In either case, I always stop to point out the special nature of the configure and how we get an inscribed triangle whose center is a special point.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:incenter}
The point just discovered is called the \emph{incenter} of the triangle.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:meeting-perp-bisectors}
Let $T$ be a triangle. For any pair of sides of $T$, the perpendicular bisectors of those sides meet. (That is, they are not parallel.)
\end{conjecture}

The typical argument here uses a proof by contradiction and the fifth postulate. It is a bit tricky to line everything up, so make the students go slowly.

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:circumcenter}
The three perpendicular bisectors of any triangle are concurrent.
\end{conjecture}

Again, the expected argument relies upon a uniqueness claim in a subtle way.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:circumcenter}
The point where the three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle meet is called the \emph{circumcenter} of the triangle.
\end{definition}

Again, I pause to discuss how this shows a triangle has a circumscribed circle whose center is at an interesting point.

I often to ask students if they explored examples. It can be nice to use GeoGebra to see that the notions of a triangle being acute, right, or obtuse correspond to the location of the circumcenter relative to the triangle. If need be, I will open GeoGebra and make a quick demonstration.


If the mood strikes me, I might also point the students toward a web search for ``Triangle Center'' so that they may see the page at the url \url{http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/}.

\section{Circles}

It is finally time to have the students read more of Euclid, now in Book III. I ask them to read the parts that do not use any theory of area. 

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:tangents-to-circle}
Let $AB$ and $AC$ be two tangent lines from a point $A$ outside a circle. Then $AB$ is congruent to $AC$.
\end{conjecture}

This is a simple consequence of the hypotenuse-leg theorem (Conjecture \ref{conj:RASS}). I reserve it for students who need a presentation.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:circles-perp}
We say that two circles \emph{meet at right angles} if the radii of the two circles to a point of intersection make a right angle.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:perp-circles}
Let $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ be two circles with centers $G$ and $O$, respectively. Suppose that these circles meet at two points $A$ and $B$. If $GAO$ is a right angle, then $GBO$ is a right angle.
\end{conjecture}

Again, this is a simple triangle congruence argument that I reserve for students who need a success. Depending on the time constraints of the semester, I may challenge the students to come up with a definition for the angle between two circles in general.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:cyclic-quad}
A quadrilateral $ABCD$ is said to be a \emph{cyclic quadrilateral} if there is a circle $\Gamma$ such that the four vertices $A,B,C$ and $D$ lie on $\Gamma$.
\end{definition}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:rect-cyclic}
A rectangle is always a cyclic quadrilateral.
\end{conjecture}

Depending on how well the students handled the material on rectangles this might be easy. If so, it is a good item for a student in need of a success.

\begin{conjecture}[Cyclic Quadrilateral Theorem]\label{conj:angles-cyclic-quad}
Let $A,B,C$ and $D$ be four points. The quadrilateral $ABCD$ is cyclic if and only if angle $DAC$ is congruent to $DBC$.
\end{conjecture}

This bi-conditional statement often gets proved in pieces, with different parts being proved by different students, since it naturally involves two theorems. If the students have continued on with my rather generous definition of polygon, this is false as stated. A non-simple cyclic quadrilateral has slightly different behavior. But that is interesting, too. I urge the students to set their own questions and conjectures and we add them to the class list.


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:tangent-to-two-circles}
Let two circles be tangent at a point $A$. If two lines are drawn through $A$ meeting one circle at further points $B$ and $C$ and meeting the other circle at points $D$ and $E$, then $BC$ is parallel to $DE$.
\end{conjecture}

This is an application of Euclid III.32. If the students do not find III.32, this might take a while to resolve.

\section{Circles, Coming 'Round Again}

This entire section consists of more challenging results about circles that may be omitted if you are running out of time and want to get to other material. In an ideal situation, one can encourage students who need more challenging material to work on these while their classmates
work on the last section.

\begin{conjecture}
Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with center $O$. Let $X$ be a point in the interior of the circle, and suppose that two lines $\ell$ and $m$ intersect at $X$ so that $\ell$ meets $\Gamma$ at points $A$ and $A'$ and $m$ meets $\Gamma$ at $B$ and $B'$.
Then twice angle $AXB$ is congruent to angle $AOB$ and angle $A'OB'$ taken together.
\end{conjecture}

This is not truly hard, but it is challenging simply for the large number of things one must keep track of. The figures get messy and it takes patience and calm to get through.

\begin{question}
Consider the situation from the last conjecture, but instead assume that $X$ lies outside $\Gamma$. What happens here? Formulate a conjecture.
\end{question}

This can be investigated with GeoGebra to discover the truth of the matter. After that, the argument is not much harder than the last item.



\begin{conjecture}
If two chords of a circle subtend different acute angles at points of a circle, then the smaller angle belongs to the shorter chord.
\end{conjecture}


\begin{conjecture}
If a triangle has two different angles, then the smaller angle has the longer angle bisector (measured from the vertex to the opposite side).
\end{conjecture}

\begin{conjecture}[Steiner-Lehmus]
If a triangle has two angle bisectors which are congruent (measured from the vertex to the opposite side), then the triangle is isosceles.
\end{conjecture}

These three items together outline an approach to the very challenging Steiner-Lehmus theorem. The hardest step remaining now is to figure out where to draw the circle.

\begin{conjecture}
Let $BC$ be a chord of circle $\mathcal{C}$, let $\widearc{BC}$ be the arc of $\mathcal{C}$ which is bounded by $B$ and $C$ and does not contain the center of $\mathcal{C}$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\widearc{BC}$.
For a point $A$ on the arc $\widearc{BC}$, show that as $A$ moves along the arc from $B$ to $M$, the sums $AB+AC$ increase.
\end{conjecture}


\begin{conjecture}[Archimedes' Theorem of the Broken Chord] Let $AB$ and $BC$ be two chords of a circle $\mathcal{C}$, where $BC$ is greater than $AB$.
(Such a configuration is sometimes called a ``broken chord.'')
Let $M$ be the midpoint of arc ${ABC}$ and $F$ the foot of the perpendicular from $M$ to chord $BC$.
Then $F$ is the midpoint of the broken chord, that is, $AB$ and $BF$ taken together are congruent to $FC$.
\end{conjecture}

\section{Construction Problems}

When I make this section available, I discuss the rules of the ``construction challenge game,'' including how one counts steps. Then when students present some of the material, I recount it again. The idea of a ``fixable compass'' requires several rounds of explanation for some students. In the end, it is just allowing the students to do all of the work of Euclid Proposition I.2 in one step. Most modern compasses have a little screw top that allows the drafter to fix a radius, and we just try to mimic that.

I also explain to the students that Euclid has many of these constructions. (They know, they have already read them.) But we are up to a slightly different task. Euclid arranges his work to optimize the logical presentation. We will instead try to minimize the number of pencil strokes required, which might complicate the proofs.

Again, each of these requires a construction recipe, an enumeration of drawing steps, and a proof that the construction works. 

These are largely taken from the excellent Hartshorne \cite{Hartshorne}.

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:angle-bisector}
Given an angle, construct the angle bisector. (par 4)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:midpoint}
Given a segment, find the midpoint. (par 3)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:perp-pt-on-line}
Given a line $\ell$ and a point $A$ lying on $\ell$, construct a line perpendicular to $\ell$ through $A$. (par 4, possible in 3)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:copy-angle}
Given an angle at a point $A$ and given a ray emanating from a point $B$, construct an angle at $B$ congruent to the angle at $A$ having the given ray as a side. (par 4)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:parallel}
Given a line $\ell$ and a point $A$ not lying on $\ell$, construct a line parallel to $\ell$ which passes through $A$. (par 3)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:circle-center}
Given the circumference of a circle, find the center of the circle. (par 5)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:tangent-circle-point}

\end{challenge}

\section{More Advanced Constructions}

\begin{definition}\label{defn:circumscribed}
A circle is said to be \emph{circumscribed} about a figure if the figure lies in the interior of the circle, except for the vertices which lie on the circle.

A circle is said to be \emph{inscribed} in a figure if the circle lies in the interior of the figure and is tangent to each of the sides of the figure.
\end{definition}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:triangle-inscribe-circle}
Construct a circle inscribed in a given triangle $ABC$. (par 13)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:triangle-circumscribe-circle}
Construct a circle circumscribed about a given triangle $ABC$. (par 7)
\end{challenge}

It is possible to omit the rest of the challenges from this section if pressed for time. They are fun to do, but not crucial.

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:cut-segment-by-circle}
Given a line $\ell$, a line segment $d$ and a point $O$, construct a circle with center $O$ that cuts off a segment from line $\ell$ which is congruent to $d$.
\end{challenge}



\begin{challenge}\label{chal:three-perp-circles}
Construct three circles such that each pair meets at right angles. (par 10)
\end{challenge}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:cut-circle-by-segment}
Given a segment $d$, a circle with center $O$ and a point $P$ inside the circle, construct a line through $P$ on which the circle cuts off a segment congruent to $d$.

When exactly is this construction possible?
\end{challenge}


\begin{challenge}\label{chal:triangle-problem}
Given a segment $AB$ and an angle $\alpha$ and given another segment $d$, construct a triangle $ABC$ with base equal to $AB$, angle $\alpha$ at $C$ and such that $AC + CB = d$.

Exactly how often is this construction possible? How many ways can the conditions be met?
\end{challenge}


\begin{challenge}\label{chal:double-tangent}
Given two circles $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ with centers $O, O'$, respectively, construct a line tangent to both circles.

How many such lines are there?

\section{The Theory of Content}

The student version of this section has a long introduction to the ideas of how Euclid treats area. This is a big intellectual shift for the students, and the class will certainly slow down as the students try to find firm footing again. The long introduction is something I do in class, too. I find it helps the students immensely to spend five minutes on an orientation session when this section is distributed. I begin by pointing out that we are still using the axiomatic method, but we have a new meaning of ``equality'' for figures. I explain that though Euclid makes the switch without further comment, I have chosen the term ``equal content'' to help separate out the ideas. If appropriate, it might help to point out that this is just a different equivalence relation. Of course, the axioms written down as a guide are really just the familiar common notions recast.

When and if it seems appropriate, I encourage students to come up with a notation for equal content that is different from the traditional equal sign. This smoothes out presentations.


\begin{problem}\label{prob:present-pythagoras} 
Prepare a presentation of Euclid's beautiful proof of Proposition I.47.
\end{problem}

This is an odd task. Unlike all the other tasks, the student is not required to do any new mathematics. But I want a chance to marvel at this argument. Usually I reserve this item for a student that needs a presentation. And when the presentation is complete I talk with the class about how the wonderment in this result is lost since they all had to memorize $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ without seeing why. I point out that this is clearly the goal towards which Euclid aimed all of Book I. I ask them to look through all of the first four books and see that each has this kind of beautiful theorem near the end.

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:false-area}
Let $ABC$ and $DEF$ be triangles. Let $X$ be the midpoint of $DE$, $Y$ the midpoint of $BC$. If $AB$ is congruent to $DX$ and $EF$ is congruent to $BY$, then $ABC$ and $DEF$ have equal content.
\end{conjecture}

This is false.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:expand-false-area}
Expand on the statement of the last conjecture--find some theorems and prove them.
\end{problem}

After the last one is settled, this allows students to exercise some creativity.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:RASS-area} 
The \emph{hypotenuse-leg} Theorem 7.2 can be proved using the theory of equal content. Find such a proof.
\end{problem}

Now it is finally time to bring out the Pythagorean theorem. Note that such an argument will require also showing that two squares of equal content must have sides which are congruent. Students often miss this point at first.

\begin{question}
There are two ways to inscribe a square in an isosceles right triangle. Which one has the greater content?
\end{question}

One way has a vertex at the right angle of the triangle. The other way has a side lying on the hypotenuse of the triangle. Of course, a satisfactory answer to the question comes with an explanation.

\begin{conjecture}[The Parallelogram Law]\label{conj:parallelogram-law}
Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram. Then the squares on the diagonals taken together have equal content with the squares on the four sides taken together.
\end{conjecture}

This is challenging because of its length and the large number of terms to juggle around. The cleanest argument I know uses both versions of the law of cosines hiding in Book II after dissecting the parallelogram along each of its diagonals.

I often pause here to discuss how Euclid is doing the work of solving certain quadratic equations in various parts of Book II, but by considering each product as an area. I then point out that it is a long time between Euclid and the modern concept of number, and the invention of a convenient notation to do algebra.\\


The next two items require no new mathematics to be done, but they do require a student to synthesize all of the material in Book II. 


\begin{problem}\label{prob:rectify-triangle}
Given a triangle $ABC$ and a segment $DE$, construct a rectangle with equal content to $ABC$ and with $DE$ as one side.
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}\label{prob:quadrature-of-rectangle}
Given a rectangle, construct a square of equal content.
\end{problem}

\clearpage
\setcounter{section}{14}
\setcounter{problem}{0}
\section{More Content}

The first two items of this section are things I always keep, but the rest can be left out if there is a time constraint.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:subtract-rect}
Given two rectangles, $P$ and $R$, construct a square $S$ so that, when taken together the content of $R$ and $S$ is equal to the content of $P$.
\end{problem}

This is a bit of a twist on the kinds of things Euclid does, but requires no new technology. One could conceivably just quote results from Book II to finish this task without any work at all, but the directness of the question and the concreteness of the rectangles and squares encourages students to put things together nicely.

\begin{problem} \label{conj:parallel-in-triangle} Use the theory of content to give a new proof of the midline theorem, Theorem 3.6.
\end{problem}

Here is another bridge to similar triangles. I pause at this point and talk to the students about how Euclid develops proportions in Book V just so he can handle similar figures in Book VI, and this result is a way to connect things.

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:circle-given-two-points-tangent}
Given a line $\ell$ and given two points $A$ and $B$ not lying on $\ell$, construct a circle passing through $A$ and $B$ and tangent to $\ell$.
\end{challenge}

Students often struggle to see the connection between this result and the concept of area. It helps to remind them to read the end of Book III, where the ideas of equal content are discussed in the context of circles.


\begin{challenge}\label{chal:circle-point-two-tangents}
Given two lines $\ell$ and $m$ and a point $P$ not on either line, construct a circle through $P$ and tangent to both $\ell$ and $m$.
\end{challenge}

The comments from the last challenge apply here, too.


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:content-triangle}
Let $ABC$ be a triangle, $DE$ a line parallel to the base $BC$, and $F$ the midpoint of segment $DE$, where $D$ lies on ray $AB$ and $E$ lies on ray $AC$. Let $AF$ meet $BC$ at $G$. Then $G$ is the midpoint of $BC$.
\end{conjecture}

Again, encourage the struggling student to find a connection to the ideas of equal content. 

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:content-circle}
Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with center $O$. Let $A$ be a point outside the circle, and $AB$ and $AC$ tangents to $\Gamma$ from $A$, with $B, C$ lying on $\Gamma$. Let $BC$ meet $OA$ at $D$. Then the rectangle on $OA$ and $OD$ has equal content with the square on $OB$.
\end{conjecture}

This is a version of the straightedge and compass construction of \emph{inversion in a circle}.

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:right-triangle-similarity}
Let $ABC$ be a right triangle with right angle at $A$. Let $AD$ be the altitude from $A$ to side $BC$. The square on side $AD$ has equal content with the rectangle on $BD$ and $DC$.
\end{conjecture}

This is related to the extraction of a square root. If the figure is constructed so that $BD$ is a unit segment, and $DC$ is some given segment, the segment $AD$ will be the square root of $DC$.


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:divide-triangle}
Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$ a point on side $BC$. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $BC$ and draw the parallel to $AD$ through $E$. Let this new line meet the union of $AB$ and $AC$ at a point $F$. Then the segment $DF$ cuts the triangle into two polygons of equal content.
\end{conjecture}

This is challenging.

\section{Regular Figures, especially the Pentagon}

Now we push on to a big finale: the construction of a regular pentagon. I tell the students that this gem of a result has been my goal all semester and ask them to work hard to get there. If time is an issue, only use the first four tasks.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:GSP-reg-pentagon}
Prepare a presentation of Euclid's construction of a regular pentagon.
\end{problem}

Again, this is a task for a struggling student, but still an interesting one.

\begin{problem}\label{prob:circle-inscribe-triangle} Given a circle, but not its center, construct an inscribed equilateral triangle in as few steps as possible. (par 7)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:square}
Construct a square in as few steps as possible. (par 9)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob:side-reg-pent}
Given a line segment $AB$, construct a regular pentagon having $AB$ as a side. (par 11)
\end{problem}

This requires re-organizing the information from Euclid to streamline the construction rather than the proof. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob:circle-three-tangent-circles}
Given a circle $\Gamma$ and its center $O$, construct inside $\Gamma$ three equal circles, each one tangent to $\Gamma$ and to the other two. (par 13)
\end{problem}

The first observation to make is that a symmetric solution would be nice. That might involve an equilateral triangle. ``Say, have you finished Problem \ref{prob:circle-inscribe-triangle}?''


\begin{problem}\label{prob:inscribed-circle-content}
Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. Let $D$ and $E$ be the midpoints of two sides, and extend segment $DE$ to meet the circle at $F$ so that $E$ lies between $D$ and $F$. Show that the rectangle on $EF$ and $DF$ has the same content as the square on $DE$.
\end{problem}

\begin{challenge}\label{chal:hexagon}
Construct a regular hexagon in as few steps as possible. What should the par value be?
\end{challenge}

\clearpage
\setcounter{section}{16}

\section{The Regular Pentagon Rides Again}


The next three tasks concern the following construction template for inscribing a regular pentagon in a circle. 

\vspace{.5in}

Given a circle with center $O$,
\begin{compactenum}
\item Draw any line through $O$; get $A$ and $B$.
\item Draw $\odot AB$.
\item Draw $\odot BA$, get $C$ as intersection of last two circles.
\item Draw line $OC$, get $D$ between $O$, $C$ as intersection with given circle.
\item Draw $\odot DO$, get $E, F$ as intersections with given circle.
\item Draw $EF$, get $G$ as intersection with $OC$.
\item Draw circle $\odot GA$, get point $H$ as intersection with ray $DO$.
\item Draw circle $\odot A(OH)$, get points $I, J$ as intersections with given circle.
\item Draw circle $\odot B(IJ)$, get points $K, L$ as intersections with the given circle.
\item (five steps) Draw segments $BK, KJ, JI, IL, LB$.
\end{compactenum}
\marginnote[-60pt]{The notation $\odot A(BC)$ means a circle with center $A$ and radius congruent to segment $BC$.}


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:pentagon-1}
Triangle $OAI$ is isosceles and its base angles are twice the angle at $O$.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:pentagon-2}
Triangle $BJI$ is isosceles and its base angles are twice the angle at $B$.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:pentagon-3}
Show that $BKJIL$ is a regular pentagon.
\end{conjecture}

I pause and challenge the students to give the reasons for the particular steps in this construction. It can help to step back and remember that each of these things has a reason for being there.

Once, I had an extra day and cooperative weather, so I took the students outside to work this construction. They worked in pairs with long bits of string and sidewalk chalk, and we drew pentagons inscribed in circles outside the math department building. (The string is good enough to serve as both straightedge and compass.) It was a fun way to celebrate all we had learned.
