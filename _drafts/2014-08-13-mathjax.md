MathJax should make for good mathematics in these posts. Here is a test
\\( \displaystyle\lim_{x_i\rightarrow \Gamma} x_i^{3\sigma} = 9 + \mathcal{o}(\sigma^2).\\) That is
meant to be in the run of text, so I will add another sentence.

And here is a displayed equation:
\\[
\int_0^1 x^{-x}\, dx = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-n}
\\]

What else might I need? Perhaps a matrix equation?
\\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\\]
