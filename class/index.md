These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

### August 22

> **Conjecture A:** (Ahrens-Goedken) The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is
> true exactly when ABCD is a square.

### August 26

> **Conjecture B:** (Goedken) Let AB be a given line segment and let RST be a given
> angle. Then it is possible to choose the point D in Miss Ahrens' construction so
> that angle BAD is congruent to angle RST.

### August 29

> **Question C:** (Pint) Is it possible to construct a "perfect rhombus?" That is,
> is it possible to construct a rhombus ABCD so that AB is congruent to AC?

### August 31

> **Question D**: (class? I didn't write down who asked.) What choices in Mr Conger's
> construction need to be avoided because they lead to _degenerate_ situations?

> **Conjecture E:** (Conger et al) Given segments GH and TJ, and given an angle QRS,
it is possible to make choices in Mr Conger's construction of a kite so that the
resulting kite ABCD has AB congruent to GH, BC congruent to TJ and angle ABC congruent
angle QRS.

### September 2

> **Conjecture F**: (Ancona) Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to AD and BC congruent
to CD. Generally angle DAB is not congruent to angle DCB.


> **Question G:** (class) with the same hypothesis, is it true that when angle DAB is
congruent to angle DCB we must necessarily have that ABCD is a rhombus?

### September 7

> **Challenge H:** (class) Give an effective definition for the concepts of
> "Merck kite" and "non-Merck kite." If done well, these definitions should
> allow us to proceed with the proposed argument for Conjecture 2.4, and also be
> the kind of thing that one can easily use to check the "Merck-ness" of a kite.

### September 9

> **Conjecture I:** (Phaly) Draw a diagram of the kind where ABCD is like a rectangle,
if angles ABC and BCD taken together
are greater than two right angles, then ray BA does not meet ray CD.


> **Challenge J:** (class) Find a reasonable way to define the term "interior angle"
for quadrilaterals.

### September 14

> **Challenge K:** (class) Let A, B, and C be collinear points. What should we
mean by the phrase " B lies between A and C"?

> **Challenge L:** (class) Let \\(\ell\\) be a line and let A and B be points.
What should  we mean by the phrase "points A and B lie on opposite sides of
line \\(\ell\\)"?

### September 23

> **Challenge M:** Introduce notation in Mr Conger's definition, and then figure out
what is going on with Miss Schultz's objection.

> **Question N:** Are the notions of a Conger convex kite and a Cohen convex kite
equivalent? State and prove a theorem.

### September 26

> **Challenge O:**
  1. Figure out where the point E in Prof Ball's argument actually ends up.
  Can we describe this point in some interesting way? Maybe we can prove that
  it never lands inside the triangle.
  2. Construct an explicit example of a triangle ABC where the points F and G
  fail to have the situation that Prof Ball claims.



### September 28

> **Challenge P:** (Bavido-Cohen-Schultz) Find a definition for convex/non-convex for
general polygons.

> **Question Q:** (Mitchell-Van Ryswyk) Should we change the definition of "exterior angle"?
Can an exterior angle really lie inside a polygon?

> **Challenge R:** (Phaly) Come up with a definition of "the point X lies inside the polygon P."

> **Challenge S:** Find language to classify these pentagons.

> **Conjecture T:** (Phaly) If ABCDE is a convex pentagon, then it is possible to insert
diagonals BD and BE to split ABCDE into three non-overlapping triangles.

### September 30

> **Question U:** (Cohen-Goedken) In a non-convex kite, can the intersection
point of DB and AC be collinear with CAE?

> **Question V:** (class) What classes of polygons break Mr Phaly's proposed
definition.

> **Question W:** (class) When two or more line segments of a polygon cross,
does the intersection create another vertex?

> **Question X:** (class) In a non-convex kite, if diagonal AC is extended to a
line, will that line AC always cross segment BD?


### October 07

> **Conjecture Y:** (Ahrens) The exterior angles of a simple polygon  
when taken together are equal to four right angles.

> **Conjecture Z:** Let P be a polygon. Let r and s be two rays with the same initial
point X. Suppose that neither r nor s meet any vertex of P. Then the number of intersections
of r and P and the number of intersections of s and P have the same parity.
