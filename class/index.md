These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

### January 13

*Conjecture A (Pace):* Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC and BDC taken
together make a right angle.

*Conjecture B (Barker-Lewis):* Let ABCD be a rhombus. If angle BAC is congruent
to angle BDC, then ABCD is a square.

*Conjecture C (class):* It is possible to construct a rhombus which is not a
square?

### January 18

*Conjecture D (Reihman):* Suppose that we have a diagram where A and D lie on
the same side of line BC. Then angles ABC and BCD taken together make two
right angles if and only if lines AB and CD are parallel.

### January 27

*Question E:* Is it possible to construct a kite which has no equilateral
triangle? (The Van Donselaar examples all have triangle ABC as an equilateral
  triangle.)

*Question F:* What is an "interior angle?"

*Question G:* What is the "interior" of a polygon?

*Question H:* How do we differentiate between the "normal-looking" and the
"odd-looking" kites? Is there some geometrical way of distinguishing these?

### January 30

*Conjecture I:* (Lewis) Given a segment AB and an angle XYZ, it is possible
to construct a rhombus ABCD with angle ABD congruent to angle XYZ using a
compass and straightedge.

### February 1

*Question J: (Peters)* Can we construct a kite with a given pair of sides and a
given pair of opposite angles. More specifically: Given angles XYZ and
\\(\alpha \beta \gamma\\), and segments TJ and PQ, is it possible to construct
a kite ABCD such that AB is congruent to TJ, BC is congruent to PQ, angle
DAB is congruent to angle XYZ and angle DCB is congruent to angle
\\(\alpha \beta \gamma\\)?

*Lemma K: (Schmidt)* Given segments AB and XY, one can construct triangle ABC so
that BA and BC are both congruent to XY.
