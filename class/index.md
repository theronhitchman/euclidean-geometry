These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

#### January 21

> **Conjecture A:** If ABCD is a rhombus and is not a square, then angle BDC is not
> congruent to angle BAC.

#### January 23

> **Conjecture B:** (Freking) If ABCD is a rhombus, then its four angles taken
> together make four right angles.

> **Question C:** (Maggert) Is it true that statments 1 and 2 are equivalent? That is,
> we have a proof that 2 implies 1. Is it possible to use statement 1 to prove statement 2?

#### January 26

> **Conjecture D:** (Rehnstrom) If ABCD is a kite but not a rhombus, then ABCD is
> not a parallelogram.

#### January 28

> **Conjecture E:** Given a segment AB, Mr Baker's construction produces
> exactly one rhombus, up to congruence.

> **Question F:** Is it possible to use Brandenburg's construction and specify
> an arbitrary angle of the rhombus? (Is any angle possible?)

> **Question G:** Do any pairs of choices of point C in Brandenburg's
> construction lead to congruent rhombi?

> **Conjecture H:** Let ABC be an isosceles triangle. Let X be the foot of the
> perpendicular line from A to BC. Then X is the midpoint of BC.

#### January 30

> **Question I:** How flexible or rigid is Mr Stuhr's construction? Find some
> theorems and prove them.
