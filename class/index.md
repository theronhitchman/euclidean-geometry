These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

#### 24 August

>  **Conjecture A (Rundall)**: The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is false.

#### 26 August

>  **Question B (Kirkpatrick-Ratz)**: Is it true that the diagonals of a
>  rhombus are also angle bisectors of the rhombus' angles?

>  **Conjecture C (Ratz)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC is
>  congruent to angle BDC only if ABCD is a square.

>  **Conjecture C' (Spiess)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC is not
>  congruent to angle BDC if and only if ABCD is not a square.

>  **Conjecture C'' (Sorensen)**: If rhombus ABCD is not a square, then
>  angle BAC is not congruent to angle BDC.

#### 28 August

> **Conjecture D (Cowden-Kirkpatrick, 1.5)**: Let XYZ be a given angle and AB a given
> segment. Then it is possible to construct a rhombus BACD such that angle BAC is
> congruent to angle XYZ using Mr Cowden's method.


#### 31 August

> **Conjecture C'''**: Suppose that ABCD is a rhombus but not a square. Then
> either A and C are obtuse and B and D are acute, or B and D are obtuse
> and A and C are acute.

#### 4 September

> **Question E (Davis)**: We know by Davis' theorem that the diagonals of a rhombus
> meet if "produced indefinitely." Must the intersection point X lie on the segments
> AC and BD?

> **Conjecture F (Bumann)**: There is a kite ABCD with segment AB congruent to
> segment BC and segment AD congruent to segment DC such that angle ABC is _not_
> congruent to angle ADC.

> **Conjecture G (Bumann)**: If ABCD is a kite and both pairs of opposite angles
> are pairs of congruent angles, then ABCD is a rhombus.

#### 9 September

> **Conjecture H (??)**: Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to BC. Then
> diagonal BD is an angle bisector of both angle B and angle D.

#### 18 September

> **Conjecture I (Sorensen)**: A parallelogram is a rectangle if and only if
> its diagonals are congruent.

#### 28 September

> **Task J**: Clean up the definition of _polygon_ to exclude those we
> dislike and include those we want.

> **Task K**: Mr Cowden's argument for 5.2 will work easily for some types
> of polygons, but less easily (not at all?) for others. Figure out how to
> describe which pentagons will work here and make a definition.

#### 30 September

> **Task L**: Come up with a good definition of the word _interior angle_ for
> polygons.

> **Task M**: Come up with a definition for _the point X lies inside the polygon P_.

#### 12 October

> **Conjecture N (Kirkpatrick)**: A convex polygon is a simple polygon.

#### 16 October

> **Conjecture O (Sorensen)**: Let ABC be a triangle with AB congruent to BC. Let
> M be the midpoint of AC. Then BM bisects angle ABC.

> **Conjecture P (Bumann)**: Let ABC be a triangle with AB congruent to BC. Let
> M be the midpoint of AC. Then angle AMB and angle CMB are right angles.

> **Conjecture Q (Kirkpatrick)**: Let ABC be a triangle. Then ABC is isosceles with
> AB congruent to BC if and only if any two of the following coincide:
>   - The angle bisector at B
>   - The median from B
>   - The altitude from B
>   - the perpendicular bisector of AC

> **Conjecture R (Rundall)**: Let ABC be a triangle. Then ABC is isosceles with AB
> congruent to BC if and only if the medians from A and C are congruent.

#### 26 October

> **Conjecture S (Spiess)**: something about a circle-line intersection property.

#### 28 October

> **Task T**: Find a good definition for the phrases "points A and B lie on
the same side of line l", and "points A and B lie on opposite sides of line l."

#### 18 November

> **Conjecture U (Hitchman):** The following definition is equivalent to our current
one:  "A polygon P is called _convex_ when for each pair of consecutive vertices
X and Y, all the other vertices of P lie on the same side of the line XY."
