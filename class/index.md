These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

### August 22

> **Conjecture A:** (Ahrens-Goedken) The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is
> true exactly when ABCD is a square.

### August 26

> **Conjecture B** (Goedken) Let AB be a given line segment and let RST be a given
> angle. Then it is possible to choose the point D in Miss Ahrens' construction so
> that angle BAD is congruent to angle RST.

### August 29

> **Question C:** (Pint) Is it possible to construct a "perfect rhombus?" That is,
> is it possible to construct a rhombus ABCD so that AB is congruent to AC?

### August 31

> ** Question D**: (class? I didn't write down who asked.) What choices in Mr Conger's
> construction need to be avoided because they lead to _degenerate_ situations?

> **Conjecture E:** (Conger et al) Given segments GH and TJ, and given an angle QRS,
it is possible to make choices in Mr Conger's construction of a kite so that the
resulting kite ABCD has AB congruent to GH, BC congruent to TJ and angle ABC congruent
angle QRS.
