These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

#### August 25

> **Question A:** (Benson) It appears that the second conclusion of Conjecture 1.1
> is true if the rhombus ABCD is a square. Is that the only way it can be true?

#### August 27

> **Question B:** What happens in the Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt Theorem
> when AC is congruent to BD?

> **Question C:** What happens in the Benson-Herbst-Nieman-Westervelt Theorem
> when AC is less than BD?

#### September 8

> **Conjecture D:** (Herbst) Let AC be a segment and X a point on this segment.
> Suppose that segment BX meets AC at right angles, and segment DX meets AC at
> right angles. Then the points B, X, and D are collinear.

> **Conjecture E:** (Walters) Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angles ABC, BCD, CDA,
> DAC, when taken together, make four right angles.


> **Conjecture F:** (Hatchett) Suppose that ABCD is a kite with AB congruent to
> AD and DC congruent to BC. If CD is greater than AD, then angle DAB is greater
> than angle DCB.

#### September 15

> **Question G:** (Bieber) How is it possible to construct a point C not lying on
> a given segment AB so that angle ACB is not a right angle?

#### September 17

> **Question H:** What should this phrase mean?
> "Points A and B lie on the same side (or on opposite sides) of line segment CD."

> **Challenge I:** Find a workable definition of the term "convex" for quadrilaterals.

> **Challenge J:** Find a workable definition of the phrase "the interior angle
> of a quadrilateral ABCD at the vertex A."

#### September 19

> Question K: Will Herbst's argument for the diagonals of a rhombus work in this
> context? If not, where does it fail?

Added later, since the context is not clear from the above: This has to do with
Mr Hawkins' theorem for Conjecture 3.3. He proves that *if* the diagonals of a
rectangle meet, then that point of intersection is the midpoint of both
diagonals. But how do we know that those diagonals meet?


#### September 22

> **Question L:** How does Scheidecker's definition for H interact with Nieman's
> construction for 2.2? In particular, what statement is needed (if any) to
> close the gap? Make a conjecture! Or explain why everything is fine.


#### September 29

> **Question M:** What is an "interior angle"? an "exterior angle?"

> **Question N:** What is the "inside" of a polygon?

> **Question O:** Is the hourglass a quadrilateral? or a hexagon? or two triangles? WTH?

#### October 3

> **Problem P:** Mr Hawkins both proves 3.4 and makes a counterexample to
> disprove 3.4. Figure out what is going on and resolve this.

> **Question Q:** Why is Miss Herbst's theorem insufficient to disprove 2.4?
> What do we need to fill in the gap?

#### October 8

> **Conjecture R:** Let P be a polygon and let X be a point not lying on one of the sides
> of P. Given a ray r with initial point X which does not pass through a vertex of P,
> let \\(n(r)\\) be the number of sides of P which meet r.
>
> If \\(n(r)\\) is even (odd) for some ray r, then it is even (respectively odd) for
> every allowed ray r.

#### October 20

> **Conjecture S:** In the situation of Goodmundson's theorem: \( T = n-2 \).

#### October 22

> **Conjecture T:** Let P be a simple \(n\)-gon. Then it is possible to divide
> P into \( n-2 \) non-overlapping triangles by inserting diagonals of P.
