These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

### January 13

*Conjecture A (Pace):* Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC and BDC taken
together make a right angle.

*Conjecture B (Barker-Lewis):* Let ABCD be a rhombus. If angle BAC is congruent
to angle BDC, then ABCD is a square.

*Conjecture C (class):* It is possible to construct a rhombus which is not a
square?

### January 18

*Conjecture D (Reihman):* Suppose that we have a diagram where A and D lie on
the same side of line BC. Then angles ABC and BCD taken together make two
right angles if and only if lines AB and CD are parallel.
