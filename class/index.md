>  **Conjecture A (Rundall)**: The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is false.

#### 26 August

>  **Question B (Kirkpatrick-Ratz)**: Is it true that the diagonals of a
>  rhombus are also angle bisectors of the rhombus' angles?

>  **Conjecture C (Ratz)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC is
>  congruent to angle BDC only if ABCD is a square.

>  **Conjecture C' (Spiess)**: Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC is not
>  congruent to angle BDC if and only if ABCD is not a square.

>  **Conjecture C'' (Sorenson)**: If rhombus ABCD is not a square, then
>  angle BAC is not congruent to angle BDC.

#### 31 August

> Conjecture C''': Supppose that ABCD is a rhombus but not a square. Then either A and C are obtuse and B and D are acute, or B and D are obtuse and A and C are acute.
