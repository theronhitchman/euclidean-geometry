These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

### August 22

> **Conjecture A:** (Ahrens-Goedken) The second statement of Conjecture 1.1 is
> true exactly when ABCD is a square.

### August 26

> **Conjecture B:** (Goedken) Let AB be a given line segment and let RST be a given
> angle. Then it is possible to choose the point D in Miss Ahrens' construction so
> that angle BAD is congruent to angle RST.

### August 29

> **Question C:** (Pint) Is it possible to construct a "perfect rhombus?" That is,
> is it possible to construct a rhombus ABCD so that AB is congruent to AC?

### August 31

> **Question D**: (class? I didn't write down who asked.) What choices in Mr Conger's
> construction need to be avoided because they lead to _degenerate_ situations?

> **Conjecture E:** (Conger et al) Given segments GH and TJ, and given an angle QRS,
it is possible to make choices in Mr Conger's construction of a kite so that the
resulting kite ABCD has AB congruent to GH, BC congruent to TJ and angle ABC congruent
angle QRS.

### September 2

> **Conjecture F**: (Ancona) Let ABCD be a kite with AB congruent to AD and BC congruent
to CD. Generally angle DAB is not congruent to angle DCB.


> **Question G:** (class) with the same hypothesis, is it true that when angle DAB is
congruent to angle DCB we must necessarily have that ABCD is a rhombus?

### September 7

> **Challenge H:** (class) Give an effective definition for the concepts of
> "Merck kite" and "non-Merck kite."" If done well, these definitions should
> allow us to proceed with the proposed argument for Conjecture 2.4, and also be
> the kind of thing that one can easily use to check the "Merck-ness" of a kite.

### September 9

> **Conjecture I:** (Phaly) Draw a diagram of the kind where ABCD is like a rectangle,
if angles ABC and BCD taken together
are greater than two right angles, then ray BA does not meet ray CD.


> **Challenge J:** (class) Find a reasonable way to define the term "interior angle"
for quadrilaterals.
