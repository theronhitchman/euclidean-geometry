These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

### January 13

*Conjecture A (Pace):* Let ABCD be a rhombus. Then angle BAC and BDC taken
together make a right angle.

*Conjecture B (Barker-Lewis):* Let ABCD be a rhombus. If angle BAC is congruent
to angle BDC, then ABCD is a square.

*Conjecture C (class):* It is possible to construct a rhombus which is not a
square?

### January 18

*Conjecture D (Reihman):* Suppose that we have a diagram where A and D lie on
the same side of line BC. Then angles ABC and BCD taken together make two
right angles if and only if lines AB and CD are parallel.

### January 27

*Question E:* Is it possible to construct a kite which has no equilateral
triangle? (The Van Donselaar examples all have triangle ABC as an equilateral
  triangle.)

*Question F:* What is an "interior angle?"

*Question G:* What is the "interior" of a polygon?

*Question H:* How do we differentiate between the "normal-looking" and the
"odd-looking" kites? Is there some geometrical way of distinguishing these?

### January 30

*Conjecture I:* (Lewis) Given a segment AB and an angle XYZ, it is possible
to construct a rhombus ABCD with angle ABD congruent to angle XYZ using a
compass and straightedge.
