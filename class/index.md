These are the conjectures and questions proposed by the class this term,
ordered by date.

#### January 21

> **Conjecture A:** If ABCD is a rhombus and is not a square, then angle BDC is not
> congruent to angle BAC.

#### January 23

> **Conjecture B:** (Freking) If ABCD is a rhombus, then its four angles taken
> together make four right angles.

> **Question C:** (Maggert) Is it true that statments 1 and 2 are equivalent? That is,
> we have a proof that 2 implies 1. Is it possible to use statement 1 to prove statement 2?

#### January 26

> **Conjecture D:** (Rehnstrom) If ABCD is a kite but not a rhombus, then ABCD is
> not a parallelogram.

#### January 28

> **Conjecture E:** Given a segment AB, Mr Baker's construction produces
> exactly one rhombus, up to congruence.

> **Question F:** Is it possible to use Brandenburg's construction and specify
> an arbitrary angle of the rhombus? (Is any angle possible?)

> **Question G:** Do any pairs of choices of point C in Brandenburg's
> construction lead to congruent rhombi?

> **Conjecture H:** Let ABC be an isosceles triangle. Let X be the foot of the
> perpendicular line from A to BC. Then X is the midpoint of BC.

#### January 30

> **Question I:** How flexible or rigid is Mr Stuhr's construction? Find some
> theorems and prove them.

#### February 6

> **Question J:** Revisit Theorem 2.2 with Rehnstrom's kite in view, and see
> what is different about the argument from rhombus to kite. Can we make a
> counterexample to 2.2? Where is the subtlety here?

#### February 11

> **Conjecture K:** (Rosie Brandenburg) These are the only ways to get
>congruent rhombi out of the construction.

#### February 20

> **Question L:** Find a good definition of "interior angle."

> **Question M:** Find a good definition of "convex pentagon."

> **Question N:** Find a good definition of "point X lies inside polygon P."


#### February 23

> **Question O:** Are the two definitions of a point lying outside a polygon equivalent?

#### February 27

Miss Jacob's Refinements of Question J:

> **Claim J1**: It is possible to construct a non-convex kite.

> **Claim J2**: If a kite is not convex, then its diagonals do not cross.

> **Claim J3**: If a kite is convex, then its diagonals cross.

#### March 2

> **Challenge P**: Find, state carefully, and prove conjectures about these new terms
> (1) same/opposite side of a line; and
> (2) convex.
> Focus on things that seems obvious or important.

#### March 23

> **Conjecture Q:** (Baker) Let L be a line and let X and Y be points lying on the same
> side of L. If Z is a point on the segment XY, then X and Z lie on the same side
> of line L.
