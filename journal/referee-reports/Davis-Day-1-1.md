## Referee Report on Proof of Conjecture 1.1a by Davis and Day

This paper is not quite ready for publication, but can be made so with some attention.

I recommend that this paper be accepted pending minor revisions.

#### Detailed notes

##### Conventions

The title of the paper is not particularly helpful. At this point, conjecture 1.1a
is well-known, but by the end of the term, a more descriptive title will be more
helpful for the readers. Can you find something that at least alludes to the
topic of the paper, or the type of results contained here?

The author's say "In this paper, a 'rhombus' will be..." Is this definition somehow
different from the usual one? The construction of this sentence suggests a departure
from the normal usage.

In the list of author's names, it is appropriate to give full names, first and last,
separated by the word "and."

It is not necessary to list the author's names in the bold theorem declaration.
Since this is the author's paper, people will naturally give credit to the authors
for work that is otherwise not indicated. The current style is more appropriate
for quoting a theorem by some other set of authors.

##### The Argument

In the proof, first sentence is unclear. Do the authors mean to construct the
segment AC, the angle bisector of BAD, or the angle bisector of BCD? How do you
know you can do such a thing? This step is unsupported.

Fourth sentence: "...all corresponding sides of triangles ABC and ADC are congruent."
What does this mean? It is not yet clear which sides correspond.

Fifth sentence: "...all three sides of the triangles are congruent" Is that true?
I see no justification that either triangle is equilateral.

##### Figures

The diagram is very nice. perhaps the labels for points C and D could be moved
out of the muddle to make them legible?

The choice to have segment AC in a different color is a good one.

##### LaTeX notes

quotations in LaTeX are a bit tricky. To get the proper items, one must actually
use two single quotes, _aimed the right way_. So a quote would be typed like

        ...  ``quoted words'' ...

so that LaTeX will typeset it correctly.
