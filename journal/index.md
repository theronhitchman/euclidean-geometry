As part of the work of this course, we will make a mathematical journal with
the students in the course as the authors, referees, and readers. I will play
the role of managing editor.

You may find it helpful to have an example of what a finished paper will look like.
This is an [interesting paper by W. W. Rouse Ball][ball] that you should read through.

## Instructions for Authors

Those researchers who have successfully presented a result and defended it
to the class should then write a mathematical paper to share their results in
a definitive form.

Like all professional journals _TEG_ has a specific style that authors must
adhere to when submitting. This gives _TEG_ a visual identity. To assist
authors, _TEG_ has arranged with a service called _Overleaf_ to submitters with a
simple online template for writing papers. Authors can find a fresh copy by clicking the
link below:

[THE OVERLEAF.COM TEMPLATE FOR WRITING PAPERS][template]

_To submit a paper_, send an email to the address **transactions.editor.uni@gmail.com**
with the subject line in the form **Euclidean Geometry Task ##** where you
replace the ##'s with the proper identifier for the task. From Overleaf there
is an option to download a pdf copy of your paper. Please rename it in the form
**LastName-Task-##.pdf** and attach it to your message.

### General Information about the Journal Submission and Review Process

Professional Journals all use some version of a peer review process. _TEG_
does the same. In general, here is how the process works.

1. Author writes a paper in a way to conform with the Journal's declared style.
2. Author submits the paper to the editorial board.
3. Editorial board finds a referee (or perhaps two, or three). Usually, the
author's name is removed.
4. Referee reads paper and checks it.
5. Referee writes a report to the editorial board, and takes a stand on whether
the paper should be published.
6. Editorial board considers opinions of the referee, makes a decision, and
forwards the report to the author.

_If the referee suggests publication:_

Usually, the author has revisions to make to improve the paper. They make these
and resubmit. Now the process starts again, but this time goes faster. When all
are satisfied, the paper is published.

_If the referee does not suggest publication:_

The author revises the paper anyway, and looks for a new journal.

***

We have only one class journal, so getting rejected from the journal will not
happen. Extensive rewriting happens pretty frequently, especially at the
beginning of the semester.

At the beginning of the semester, I shall act as the managing editor and sole
referee. After a few successful papers, you may be asked to referee also.

After submitting a paper, you should expect to get a referee’s report and have
some editing to do before the paper gets published. When you have more practice,
the amount of reworking a paper requires will likely go down significantly.

### Technical Manual for Authors

Papers written for Transactions in Euclidean Geometry should be submitted as
[Overleaf.com](http://www.overleaf.com) links. Use the template provided above,
as this will include all of the relevant styling and structure.

#### How to Start a Document:

Navigate a web browser to the “Writing” page of our course web site.
Follow the link “THE OVERLEAF.COM TEMPLATE FOR WRITING PAPERS.”

When the document comes up, note the url of the web page you are at. This url
has a random string at the end which serves as Overleaf.com’s identifier for
the file. If you wish to find your file again, you will need this url.

Alternatively, you can make an account at Overleaf.com. This will allow you
to keep all of your papers together in a particular place.

#### How to Use the Overleaf.com template:

Scan down the left-hand pane of the Overleaf setup until you see things that
need actual customization. Change the title of the document, and put your name
in the author command. Change the rest of the document as appropriate to use
your theorems and your arguments supporting them.

#### How to Include a Figure:

To include a figure, you will first have to make one. I suggest using GeoGebra.
It has a nice “export” feature that will allow you to save a `.jpg` or a `.png`
file. Download that file to the desktop of your working machine.

Then upload the figure into Overleaf.com by using the menu item
`file-> upload figures, etc.` Change the code for a figure in the template to
use the appropriate file name.

#### How to Submit your Article to the Journal.

To submit a paper, send an email to the managing editor with the subject line
in the form Euclidean Geometry Task ## where you replace the ##'s with the
proper identifier for the task. From Overleaf there is an option to download a
pdf copy of your paper. Please rename it in the form `LastName-Task-##.pdf` and
attach it to your message. It might be helpful to include the url of the
Overleaf page for your document, too. Send yourself a copy of this email.
This is the way to make sure you can find the file again when you want to edit
it. Documents on Overleaf.com are found by using the proper url, which
contains a fairly random string as an identifier. If you don’t save that string,
it will be near impossible to find your work again.

Managing Editor’s Email address for papers: `transactions.editor.uni@gmail.com`

### Style Guide for Authors

To help potential authors produce the best work they can, TEG has some style
requirements for articles. Please adhere to these when writing.

- Articles should adhere to standard English usage, grammar, and spelling.

- Mathematics is written in present tense. It is eternal and enduring.

- Mathematics is not a personal narrative. Do not choose the personal pronoun
"I" when writing. If a personal pronoun must be used, please use "We."

- Mathematics is written in an active voice, not a passive voice. If you are
unclear on this concept, consider if your sentence might still make sense if you
add “by zombies” at the end of it. If so, it is likely a passive voice
construction.

> For example: The brains were eaten by zombies.  All men are created equal by
> zombies. I got kicked in the face by zombies.

- Each statement written should have a clear justification given from the
literature.

> References to Euclid’s Elements are given this way: "... by Euclid II.13..."
> That is a reference to Proposition 13 of Book II of the Elements.  References to
> work produced for this journal should be given by the name of the author and the
> official sequence number/letter. For example: "... by Mr Jones' Theorem 2.3..."
> and "... by Miss Marple’s Theorem F..." are correct.

- Authors are encouraged to include figures which enhance the exposition. A
simple visual aid can go a long way toward making an argument understandable.
But authors are cautioned that a figure is not an argument, just a supplement.
Write as if there is no figure, but include one anyway.

_Transactions in Euclidean Geometry_ strives for a classical feel, so authors
are discouraged from using
mathematical symbols when words will do. English prose is easier to read than
long strings of strange glyphs.

> For example: The sentence "Triangle ABC is congruent to triangle XYZ." is
> preferable to the sentence "\\(\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ \\)."

- Authors are **strongly** discouraged from using mathematical symbols to start
sentences. This makes a paper jarring to read, and can lead to confusion.

### Information for Referees

**Important: Referees should save a copy of the original submission of a paper they
review. It will be necessary to include this in your portfolio assignment.**

#### A note about the proper tone:

The peer review process is important for improving the quality of written
mathematical work, but receiving a referee’s report is uncomfortable. The
process is inherently critical and likely negative.

To reduce the strain on authors, it is critical that a referee depersonalize
the comments made. In particular, comments should focus on the paper, and not
on the author. The best mode is to focus each comment on some specific aspect
of the paper, and to never mention the fact that the paper has an author.

> For example: "... paragraph three is confusing. How does one conclude that..."
> is fine. But "... Mr Jones is stupidly confusing the statement of theorem 4
> in paragraph three..." is very bad.

In short, be specific, and talk about features of the paper. If you must
reference the author in some way, refer to him or her as "the author," never
by name.


#### What goes in a report:

Appropriate things to put in a referee report include:

- comments about the logic of an argument
- comments about passages that you feel are confusing
- comments about poor grammar and spelling
- comments about the appropriateness of figures
- comments about the lack of adherence to the style guide of the journal

A challenging thing is that you should limit yourself to pointing out
deficiencies, and refrain from making corrections for the author. A suggestion
might be allowable. But telling the author how to write a paper is not usually
well received.


#### How to file a report:

Make a simple text document, and type out each comment on its own line. It helps
if you start each comment with a bit of location information. For example,

> In the third paragraph, the second sentence: the grammar here is unclear.

or

> On page 2, third line from the bottom: Is that really 'triangle DEF'?
> I expected 'triangle EDF'.

This report should be shared with the author as soon as is reasonably possible,
and within a week in any case.
