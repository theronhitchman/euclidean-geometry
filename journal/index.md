As part of the work of this course, we will make a mathematical journal with
the students in the course as the authors, referees, and readers. I will play
the role of managing editor.

For more information on writing for the class journal, see the instructions on
the [page about writing][writing].

You may find it helpful to have an example of what a finished paper will look like.
This is an [interesting paper by W. W. Rouse Ball][ball] that you should read through.
