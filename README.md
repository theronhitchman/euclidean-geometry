Course Notes and web site for Euclidean Geometry

This is a set of course notes for an IBL college mathematics course in classical Euclidean Geometry.
Material covered corresponds roughly to the first four books of Euclid. Problems are chosen to
complement the text, and to teach the following basic arts of a mathematician:

- finding and constructing arguments
- proper use and making of mathematical definitions
- making conjectures
- resolving questions

The typical audience for this class consists of second and third year students at a medium-sized,
comprehensive public University. Most students are pre-service teachers.

This set of notes began as an outgrowth of Chapter One of Robin Hartshorne's _Geometry: Euclid and Beyond_.
Readers who compare these notes to that excellent text will see the clear debt owed.

The `jiblm` branch contains the files required to generate the version submitted to
the Journal of Inquiry Based Learning in Mathematics (last revised June 2016).
